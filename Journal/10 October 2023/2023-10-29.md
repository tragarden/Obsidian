Spent a few hours converting my notes to markdown, linking and tagging 003 Hardware in my A+ notes.

Woke up to a foot of snow this morning, felt very tired, lethargic, and somewhat sick upon waking.  Ashlee came in soon after and laid in bed with me, resulting in sex soon after.  It was nice to do so early in the morning, really allowed for some clear thinking in lieu of the headache I have had.  Did some of the kitchen dishes before making biscuits and gravy, Ashlee made the biscuits and I made the gravy with onions, shallots, mushrooms, and garlic.  Ate that along with some chicken from the night before and watch Floribama shore for a bit.  After eating we got on social media for awhile.  Ashlee eventually played Tears of the Kingdom for a bit and I started converting my notes.   Had a modest but consistent amount of weed today.  Put the bird feeder out by the car port and dozens of birds, towhees, jays, and juncos have been hopping around all day driving cornbread nutty.  I think Ashlee's sister Jamie had her baby either this morning or last night, and Ashlee seems relieved in some way.  The snow is really nice to look at, when I was outside it was extremely silent and still.
