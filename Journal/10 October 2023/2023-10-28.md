Spent 3 hours adding links and tags to The 002 Networking and 003 Hardware notes within my A+ certification files.  

Woke up feeling very cold since it was in the 20s F / -10s C.  Felt stressed out about going to therapy but somewhat relieved because today was a day of reassessment.  Talked to John about being afraid to file my health insurance application, and he told me that the worst case scenario of penalty he has ever seen was a loss of coverage.  I set new goals for the next  six months and felt pretty accomplished about my progress over the years.  
Went to Whole Foods with Ashlee afterwards to get a few meals for the incoming snow storm.  Looking forward to this early and unexpected snow day.  Made me reflect on how nice the weather has been all year.  Spent some time weatherproofing and insulating the sun room today, grilled some chicken, converted some of my notes to markdown, and overall had a great day.  Felt pretty nice to stand in the falling snow and grill the chicken at 450F.  Came out amazing after about 30 hours of marinating in whatever ashlee put it in.  
Finding it much easier to stay sober until later in the day now.
