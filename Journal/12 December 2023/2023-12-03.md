Woke up later than usual, around 8:30am and groggily got up. Ashlee was playing zelda and it was snowing. We talked for awhile and worked things out after a very intense day of arguing and battling yesterday. I took cornbread out to play in the snow for a bit. When ashlee left for work the snow was somewhat deep, and she got the outback sideways in the steepest part of the driveway. She called out of work as a result and I managed to get the car up the snow road and back to the house. After that I played bass for an hour or so with the amp turned on which is unusual for me. Slaves and bulldozers and some james brown songs. After that I began studying HTB modules for a few hours. Had a shot of vodka in some tonic water which was pretty gross and made me feel sick. Considering eating a large mushroom today but feeling a little apprehensive.
