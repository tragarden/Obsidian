Had a poor night of sleep, was still tripping when I went to my bedroom around 9:30pm.  Stayed up for a few hours watching youtube and browsing reddit. Was only slightly impaired but was kept up by our neighbor's dogs and lights, a rare occasion. Woke up around 6:30am to the cats crying and making noises. Ashlee got up at 6:55am and asked for help taking out the trash.  Was somewhat avoidant of her before she headed to work around 10am, as she seemed irritable and annoyed.  Spent some time taking notes about networking and setting up a home network, intending on installing my VPN router and Pi-Hole into our network setup. 

Spent 3.5 hours learning about home network technology and security, setting up routers, switches, vpns, access points, and mesh network protocols like Z-Wave and Zigbee. Started learning about open source smarthome automation, subnetting networks, and securing your network. After that I dug through the 2-week old trash to find the dab beads that ashlee accidentally threw away. After that I had some cereal, croutons, and a plate of white rice. Feeling pretty tired, avoided weed til about 3pm.

Tasks for the day include:
- Dishes
- Clean mushroom box
- Look through trash for my beads
- Reconfigure Home network
- Apply for medicaid
- install pi-hole
- yoga

- take vitamins
- cat box
