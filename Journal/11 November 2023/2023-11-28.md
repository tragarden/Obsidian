This was a pretty bad day, woke up feeling sick with a headache that lasted all day really. Felt frustrated with Ashlee and we are not getting along or communicating well. I feel like she is unchanging and when I voice my feelings or opinions she claims I'm attacking her, gets defensive, and escalates the argument leaving me with no progress or validation. I feel like I need to avoid her daily in order to keep peace in the house because she has become so sensitive to anything I say that nearly all conversation sparks an argument. She had the day off but we didn't talk for the majority of the day. She stayed in the living room and I stayed at the computer most of the day. Talked to my mom for a bit when she went to the store because marc was in the hospital visiting bill, who doesn't seem to have much time left on earth. He has severe cancer infestation and as of today they estimate he will die within 4-5 days. I feel sad about it but also like it's too late to talk to him or comfort him in anyway. He has been in my life for a very long time and he has faded from my life over the years. I feel weird and sad that when we went to his house I felt scared, anxious, and sick and avoided going out on the boat with him. Got in bed around 5pm but couldn't sleep, finished off the night with a pizza and a salad before going to bed around 9:30 pm.
