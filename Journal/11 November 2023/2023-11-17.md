Woke up feeling okay, slept well and with few interuptions which was nice. Texted John right after waking up to tell him that I have not applied for insurance yet and that I feel really embarrassed, scared, and ashamed for not appl Made some coffee and got ready to do some gardening jobs with Amanda. They were somewhat of a bust - one was completely canceled, one was much easier and shorter than expected, and the last was coaltrain liquors which only took about an hour. After that I returned home to talk to EJ for  about two hours. He showed me some poroblems he has been working through solving problems with coding. Had some difficulty focusing and felt a bit tired and stoned. After that I cleaned off all the outdoor window sills and surveyed the yard for changes. Came inside and had a burrito before digging into some hackthebox modules. Amanda called and asked if I wanted some temporary and part-time work at the Dollar Tree in Monument with her mom. I have not responded yet but am somewhat interested.
