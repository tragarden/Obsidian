Woke up feeling a bit cold, got up and played Mario Galaxy for a bit before getting ready for my 9am therapy session. My mom sent me the eulogy that Matt Collins wrote for his mom which made me feel sad that I couldn't be there for him. It felt awkward to return to therapy. We talked about how I reinstated my health insurance but still feel like it will be taken away from me, or that soon I will face another application and assessment which is the part I feel afraid of. We also talked about receiving my inheritance from Marc's mom, my grandmother Anita. We discussed this for 15 minutes or so, never really getting anywhere with it and sort of circling around a key idea but never identifying it. This is likely due to my other identities preventing me from sharing something that may be hidden. We moved on to talking about how my personalities are blended and we need to work on separating them so they each have their own set of feelings that are separate from other identities. I felt like this was forceful although John didn't agree. This confusion lead to the idea that I would create a bill of rights or a sort of constitution for how I relate to my other identities. When I came home I played Mario galaxy for about two hours. Hopped on HTB for 1.5 hours and ended because I just feel mentally spent with a lingering headache. Feeling sweaty and uncomfortable in my clothes. Tired as well. Still not feeling great but not feeling as sick as i did yesterday.
