Slept well and throughout the whole night. Woke up feeling neutral and slightly annoyed. Browsed reddit for awhile waiting for ashlee to wake up, poured myself the rest of my cold brew in the fridge, and went to my desk to be alone. The mushroom box has become totally compromised with fly larvae and there are 50-100 flies at a time now. Made it to my gardening job near UCCS around 10am and worked for about three hours with Amanda. Did cutback and had light annoyance with our client who was arguing about whether or not she had garlic growing in the front yard. We think it is hyacinth and that Amanda actually planted them intentionally two years ago. We were asked to remove them anyway. She then asked us to perform another assanine task of trying to threadlock this yard art pole in her yard that was mishapen and broken.  When I went home I spent a few hours planting the hyacinth bulbs I brought home and watering the yard. Ashlee was gone in pueblo for many hours, when she came home she brought mexican food from down the street and weed from pueblo. She told me distressing things about her family visit like Jamie's boyfriend's house filled with christian t-shirts held up by thumbtacks. She also said her brother was just roaming around with handguns in the waistband. We ate food and I went to bed pretty early.
