Woke up stewing in my bad mood from yesterday and feeling reluctant to get out of bed or socialize with Ashlee at all. Eventually got up around 8 when the cats were being annoying, got on the couch while Ashlee fed the cats. After she sat on my lap and was nice to me, which lead to intense sex for about an hour. After that we showered off and had dabs. I addressed my frustration with her about how she has been creating piles of mess around the house, right after we clean, and especially after work or before she leaves the house. I felt apprehensive about bringing it up since she has been fairly hostile lately, but to my surprise she didn't offer resistance and agreed that she is not happy with her habits either. We shared a burrito before working through the dishes, she left for a noon shift and I finished up the dishes. After that I started working on HackTheBox modules for about two hours before taking a 15 minute break to write the journal entry for today and yesterday.
