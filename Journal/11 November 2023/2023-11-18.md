Woke up very early this morning when Ashlee left for an early bread shift at Whole Foods. She woke me up before leaving and we  messed around a little before she left around 5:50am. Beat after she rolled out, then got up and started milling about the house. Browsed reddit for awhile before preparing to go to my 9am half-session of therapy. Driving to the session I felt a bit annoying and like I was being dumb for having to drive all the way across town just do dude can tell me that it's okay to feel stressed out about applying for Medicaid. He said that I shouldn't feel embarrassed or ashamed because it is directly related to my programming and that this is unusually difficult for someone like me. He reassured me a few times before sending me on my way. He is going to hold the session position for me for two weeks, but if I do not manage to get insurance or cash by then, he will have to wait-list me and let someone else have the slot. When I got home I started to work on modules for networking on HackTheBox. Did this for an hour before Ashlee came home around 2pm. We really didn't talk much, had some pizza and salad and watched some shows for awhile. I had a dab and got really tired around 6 o clock, feeling very depressed and distant from ashlee. Sat in silence for awhile before I decided to just go to bed. Took me a long time to fall asleep and ended up taking another dab about an hour after getting into bed. Felt very alone and sad and unwanted by everyone.
