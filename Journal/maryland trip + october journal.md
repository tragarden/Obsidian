I haven't written in my journal since mid september.  I started to feel frozen and panicked as soon as I booked the trip to MD.  When the plane tickets were bought, I felt pretty distressed and hyper-fixated on that until well until after my layover weeks later lol.  I felt bothersome and unwanted, and like I was being a burden on all my friends that have 'real' lives, families, serious jobs and responsibilities; I felt like a child who wanted attention. When I was contacting Aaron and Danny, and Andrew to a certain extent, I was feeling annoying and like they weren't excited to have me come visit although their actions and words clearly showed me otherwise.  Another stressor before I went, was a few days before I left, I talked to Darren and made plans to see him immediately before he started using the N-word profusely during our phone call. I pretty much decided in that moment that I wasn't going to see him, which made me feel sad and mad at him, overall very anxious because I knew it would be confusing to him and I didn't want to talk to him directly about it.  

Felt really stressed out about leaving the cats and getting everything ready with the house before leaving.  I spent a good amount of time cleaning up the yard, planting remaining plants, bringing in the house plants that were outside and cleaning those up, mowing, chopping down tall areas.  While I was using the reel mower on the strip of lawn adjacent to Todd's house, he popped out and jokingly asked me if I needed gas, which allowed me a segue to ask for his contact information for emergencies sake.  This was something I was quite stressed about, but I felt reassured talking to him and he seems like a really kind guy.  We have had correspondence since which was nice as well. Cleaned the house extensively and unplugged the ovens and catproofed where we could.

The night before we left was very stressful and panicked feeling for me.  We needed to wake up at 3:30am and I slept through my alarm, which hasn't happened in years to my memory.  I felt really alarmed and stressed immediately.  The whole process of going to the airport, making sure the door was locked, going through security, getting our tickets, etc. was stressful.  I kept checking my bag compulsively, dozens of times,  sometimes an instant after the zipper closed.  Did this what seemed like hundreds of times over the course of multiple flights to Baltimore and back. Easily did it 100+ times.

The plane rides were stressful but in most cases I was seated with Ashlee, a masker, or otherwise polite person.  The noise canceling headphones made a notable improvement of my flights, lowering my stress a lot. Departing from Texas was stressful because at the gate they told me I would have to hand over my carry-on as they were going to check it, I felt confused because this has never happened to me before.  I asked the dude if it was optional, and he curtly said no and took my bag.  

When we landed, I felt pretty calm finally and we called Andrew while we waited at the baggage claim.  There was this girl in all red with hair curls similar to mine, something I have never really seen before.  They looked weird and unnatural, different than how mind occur.  There was also this dude that was probably definitely on stimulants in a tight gray suit, styled hair and sunglasses, rapidly talking into his bluetooth earpiece and looking into the mirrored pillar next to him every 11 seconds to make sure he didn't shapeshift in front of everyone.  Andrew picked us up which felt weird because I haven't seen him in so long.  He drove us to his house with mild aggression and Ashlee and I remained in a daze for at least that night and into the next day.  

  When we got to his house, we met his cats, had dabs and idled in a stunned way for a bit, then headed to Royal Farms to get some fried chicken, greeted by dancing and hollering employees as soon as we walked in. We walked around Highlandtown a bit eating fried chicken. Andrew took us to MobTown brewing, a few blocks from him in Highlandtown. I had some super good pretzel beers, a 'pasta water', Andrew bought a sixer of pretzel guys and Yuengling's then we went back to his house. It felt really nice to walk around the city and have someone else guide me through the city.

I got significantly drunk, we grilled out and made chicken and drank, Ashlee disappeared at some point to go to sleep and I stayed up with MAtt and Andrew til around midnight.  Felt so exasperated and blown, unable to think normally or accomplish much.
