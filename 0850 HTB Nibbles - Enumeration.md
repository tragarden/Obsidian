# Enumerating 'Nibbles'

Nibbles is a #Linux based Virtual Machine ( #VM) available on the Hack The Box platform that helps us practice enumeration, web app exploitation, and exploiting file misconfiguration. 

#### Information Gathering

When we are introduced to Nibbles, we are already presented with some information up front, making this a Gray-box penetration test. We know that this machine is running Linux Operating System ( #OS), the associated #IP address, and that is has a web-based vulnerability.
