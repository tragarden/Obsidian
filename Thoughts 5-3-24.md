I am surprised to realize that in all the times we talked about 'someone' coming to the door and why that's such a stressful thing for me. I just remembered that after I moved in with my stepdad in the suburbs, he started making me answer the front door, getting the mail, and occasionally answering the phone. I remember these all being great points of stress to me - and have some unusual experiences tied to them. 

I remember being stressed about walking by my neighbors on the way to a shared mailbox that passed every house in our row. Across from the mailbox at my first house was a neighbor that would call the police on me for unusual things like sitting on my bike near the mailbox for too long or passing by her house too many times on my bike. Her family had a rivalry with most of the other kids in the neighborhood. 

I can remember my friend being at my house and in mixed company of adults and children someone said 'sexy' and I felt extremely uncomfortable on the deck with my parents and a friend. I remember my friend reacting in a non-chalant way about the situation. This was in the first grade. 

Around this same time I can remember playing in a sprinkler on a hill in between two rows of townhouses. I can remember a girl pulling my pants down and feeling humiliated around this same time. 

This is the same time that I can remember telling people I was actually a girl, also same time that I would pretend to be a 'fuzz-it' which is the 'weeple' brand puffball toy from the 80s-90s.

When I talked to my mom she said that the dentist experience I had in the home-studio was definitely painful and the dentist refused to wait for the numbing agent to activate before working on me. She said that we went twice but I only remember it as a single experience. This was also during the same time period as above, maybe earlier. 

I can remember taking a praying mantis to school as my pet and my kindergarten teacher (maybe first grade) made me release it into the woods. I remember that she had an emotional response to me saying that she was making me get rid of my only friend. 

I remember having to answer the door and lie to the person standing there on behalf of my parents who didn't want to answer the door or see the person that was visiting. I have a feeling like one or more times I answered the door to something threatening or something I was afraid of. I would say that I likely had similar experiences on the phone.

# summary

I am surprised that I haven't thought to bring up scenarios from this time period until now. These are stories I have told a lot of times but never really considered their significance until now.
