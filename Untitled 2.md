**The days of the on-prem data center are over—or so public opinion would seem to say. However, the reality is far from that: on-prem data centers are thriving now more than ever, driven by a number of requirements placed upon organizations.**

Now, this is not to say there is no place for the public cloud. Rather, the right solution for most organizations is a hybrid approach—combining the best of both on-prem and public cloud. Achieving this brings about a number of unique challenges that must be considered with intelligent solutions put in place to solve.

Join our upcoming webinar on Tuesday, December 20 at 12pm PT / 3pm ET to learn why a robust cloud native strategy can’t ignore on-prem—and how a hybrid approach overcomes both public cloud and on-prem pain points.

In this webinar, we'll discuss:

- Why on-prem data centers are still relevant in today’s world of cloud native computing
- The challenges of relying only on public cloud for your application infrastructure
- How on-prem and public cloud data centers can “co-exist”, and the benefits you can gain by doing so
- Factors you need to consider when designing your infrastructure for both on-prem and public cloud
- How Mirantis can help you solve the challenge of managing a hybrid on-prem and public cloud based infrastructure, while reducing your effort in the on-going management to allow focus on your core value

See you at the webinar!
