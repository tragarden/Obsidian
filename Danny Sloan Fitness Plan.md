## Daily Warm Up

### Cardiovascular Warm-up

Warming up is a crucial part of any workout and should be paired with stretching. Research from the [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/in-depth/stretching/art-20047931 'clinical analysis of stretching from the Mayo Clinic') shows that a light warmup before stretching offers protection from injury that may occur when muscles are cold. A light physical activity to initiate increased blood flow and respiration is enough to 

### Stretching

Stretching before physical activity may improve your performance, decrease the risk of injuries, improve range of motion, increase blood flow. Focus on major muscle groups and keep stretching even on both sides of the body. Note that stretching is NOT a warmup as it does not stimulate the cardiovascular system in the same way that a light jog would. 

### Pre-lift Warm Up

Danny suggests a few exercises to further warm up for lifting:

- **Pull-ups** - do three sets at maximum reps.
- **Light Shoulder Flys** - [Front Raises](https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/front-two-dumbbell-raise 'bodybuilding.com guide for front raises'), [Side Raises](https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/side-lateral-raise 'bodybuilding.com guide for side lateral raises'), and [Bent-over Deltoid Flys](https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/up-rear-delt-fly 'bodybuilding.com guide for Bent-over Rear Deltoid Fly') will ensure that you hit all three heads of the shoulder. Place your thumbs over the grip for this. 
- **Dumbbell Curls** - High reps of [Straight Curls](https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/dumbbell-bicep-curl 'bodybuilding.com guide for straight bicep curls') and [Hammer Curls](https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/hammer-curls 'bodybuilding.com guide for hammer bicep curls') below a 30lbs threshold. 
- **Dumbbell Lunges** - 50 [Lunges](https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/dumbbell-lunges 'bodybuilding.com guide for Lunges') in two sets of 25 reps is suggested. Lower until you feel your calf flex. 

## Workouts

Now let's PUMP. These workouts are hard but we're here to push for more, right? During these workouts, primarily focus on correct form and pushing past discomfort into overtime. A light burning is NOT enough if you want big results - remember why you are different and why you will progress faster than anyone you know!

### HIIT

High Intensity Interval Training or [HIIT](https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/high-intensity-interval-training-the-ultimate-guide.html ''bodybuilding.com guide to HIIT) is a training method where you alternate between intense and explosive anaerobic exercises and short rest periods.

After every workout you should be performing your HIIT session. If you don’t perform your HIIT after your lifts, make sure you get in at least 3 sessions of HIIT a week - preferably 5. 

Proven studies have shown that when elevating your heart rate with an interval system, you're much likely to have a lower body fat percentage. All HIIT workouts should be done as fast as you can and as if you're racing yourself!!!

- [**Burpee Pull-ups**](https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/burpee-pull-up 'bodybuilding.com guide to burpee pull-ups')
	- These are exactly what they sound like - locate yourself underneath a pull-up bar and you start first with a burpee, then jump to pull yourself up using momentum from the jump. 
	- Time yourself for 20 reps, then rest for double the time and do as many rounds as possible for 20 minutes of total time!

- [**Box Jumps**](https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/front-box-jump 'bodybuilding.com guide to box jumps')
	- Grab a box or a platform that is a good comfortable height for you to jump on with BOTH feet leaving the ground at the same time.
	- Time yourself for 20 reps, keeping track of the time will help you strive for a faster time. 
	- Remember the faster you move, the more HBPM and the more fat you burn.  
	- Rest for about double the working time or sooner if possible - if you feel you're ready to beat your time before the rest period is up, it can only benefit you by doing so!

- [**Sprints**](https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/par46.htm 'bodybuilding.com guide to sprinting')
	- If you're outside or have running space you want to measure about 40 yards or 120 feet.
	- Make sure you warm up and stretch out first. 
	- Sprint as fast as you can in the 40 yard range, again acting as if you have a dog right behind you and you're running from him. 
	- As human beings our survival methods are meant to be running from something.
	- Think back to the caveman days, the strong would survive so we need to perform these “FIGHT or FLIGHT” methods to maintain a low body fat. 
	- Depending on how far you get your body into this fight or flight method will determine the rest period. You want to perform another sprint when you feel you can beat or at least come close to it. 
	- I recommend resting for 1-2 minutes after a 5-10 second sprint. Total HIIT time 20 minutes. You can also perform sprints on a treadmill with it being  ON or OFF!       

- [**Rower**](https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/leverage-iso-row 'bodybuilding.com guide to seated row machine')
	- Row 500 meters as fast as you can. 
	- Rest time should be equal to performance time. 
	- Total working time 20 minutes
	- This is a machine in the gym that is very neglected but a great resource for torturing body fat.

HIIT workouts should be performed minimum 3 times a week - I prefer daily, but make 5 days a week the goal!

You can pick which HIIT workout you want but I recommend trying all of them and sticking with the one that gives you the best workout!!!!

### REST

[Rest days](https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/the-importance-of-rest-days-and-how-to-do-them-right.html 'bodybuilding.com guide to rest days') should be taken as needed. Listen to your body because recovery is essential to this process. We are here to reach new heights but we are also in this for the long, good years to come… so train hard and train safe!

### Meal Breakdown

**Meal 1** - One item from Group A and Group B

**Meal 2** - One item from Group A and Group B

**Meal 3** - One item from Group A, Group C, and Group D

**Meal 4** - CHOICE of any two items on the entire list. It doesn’t matter which group although I do
not recommend to pick TWO items from group B 

**Meal 5** - One item from Group A, Group C, and Group D

**Meal 6 or Dessert** - If you're hungry have Greek yogurt stuffed Protein crepes. 
	Recipe - 1 scoop of protein powder, mixed with two whole eggs. Whip them up and cook very thin. Once we have the crepes, add on a non fat Greek yogurt (flavor of your choice) and roll them up and enjoy.

ONE DAY A WEEK WE MUST HAVE A “REFEED DAY” IT DOESNT MATTER WHICH DAY, BUT ON THAT DAY WE ARE DROPPING GROUP C AND ADDING IN GROUP B, SO EACH MEAL YOU WILL BE EATING FROM GROUP B (YAYY FOR CARBOHYDRATES) 

WITH A HIGH DAY WE MUST ALSO HAVE A LOW DAY :( BUT ITS GOOD FOR THE BODY SO ON THIS DAY (ANY DAY, PREFERABLY THE DAY AFTER YOUR HIGH DAY) WE WILL BE GETTING RID OF GROUP B AND ADDING C TO REPLACE. Keep the carbs low on this day.

*All meals don’t have to be timed out, or separated, just make sure you eat all 5 meals within a 24 hour period.

I know you will have questions but we’ll be a few steps further after you read up!
