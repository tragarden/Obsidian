# Variables in Algebra

Variables are symbols that represent an unknown or yet-to-be determined numerical value. They are used to represent values that change within a given equation. While any symbol could be used, it is typical to use letters from the alphabet.

#### Multiplication Symbol

While many recognize the symbol 'x' as the sign used for multiplication. 

In algebra, it is a common practice to use a dot '.' to represent the multiplication sign since the variable 'x' is often used, which can lead to confusion. When multiplying a constant by a variable, the dot '.' or 'x' symbol can be completely omitted.

When multiplying two constants, you can alternatively represent multiplication by placing one or more of the constants within parentheses.
