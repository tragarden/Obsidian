# Dividing by Zero

Dividing by zero remains undefined because mathematicians have never developed a sufficient answer to explain this phenomenon. One might argue that it is impossible to have an answer for this.

When we divide by zero, the result is theoretically infinity - this idea is derived from the expressions below:

>1 / 0.1 = 10
>1 / 0.01 = 100
>1 / 0.000001 = 1,000,000

If we consider this concept from the other direction using negative values, we encounter a paradoxical result:

>1 / -0.1 = -10
>1 / -0.01 = -100
>1 / -0.000001 = -1,000,000

Based on this information, one would deduce that when we are dividing by zero, the result could simultaneously be infinity and negative infinity. This is why dividing by zero is classified as an undefined value.

### Zero Divided by Zero

Zero divided by zero is still undefined because in all cases, we still have the result of zero in all cases:

>0 / 0.1 = 0
>0 / 0.01 = 0
>0 / 0.000001 = 0

If we divide two numbers that are close to zero, we will always get a result of 1:

>0.0000001 / 0.0000001 = 1
>-0.0000001 / -0.0000001 = 1

Since these examples illustrate that dividing by zero could result in an answer of 1 or 0, it remains undefined.

### Indeterminate 

If we assume that x =/= 0:

>x / 0 = y
>(x / 0) \* 0  = k \* 0
>x = 0

If we then assume that 0 / 0 = k:

>( 0 / 0 ) \* 0 = k \* 0

One could then derive that:

>0 = k \* 0

This would mean that ANY value could be true for K. In cases like this, we say that this value is indeterminate because there is an infinite number of possible answers for variable K.
