# Equivalent Expressions

We can find equivalent expressions through combining like terms and factoring via constants. This can be used to reduce complexity of expressions.

An Expression is a combination of constants, variables, and operators.

An Equation features an equal sign to represent equivalency between two expressions.

We will find an equivalent expression for the following

>x + 2y + x + 2
>x + x + 2y + 2
>2x + 2y + 2
>2(x + y)
