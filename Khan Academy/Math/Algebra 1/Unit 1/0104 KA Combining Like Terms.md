# Combining Like Terms

Combining like terms means adding up the coefficients that appear before the same variable. A coefficient is just the number that a variable is multiplied by. A rational coefficient is a representation of a fractional or decimal value.

>2x + 3x = 0

In the above statement, the coefficients 2 and 3 can be added together since they are both used to multiply the variable x. This equation can then be rewritten in the following simpler form:

>5x = 0

When multiple variables are present, the same rule applies to all like variables. The same can be said for constants. We will simplify the following expression:

>5x + 10y + 10 + 10x + 5y +25 = 0

>15x +15y + 35 = 0

### Distributive Property

The Distributive Property from arithmetic states that multiplying the sum of two or more addends by a given number will yield the same result as multiplying each addend individually. 

An addend is a number that is added to another to form a sum.

This is represented with the following expression:

>A(B + C) = AB + AC
>A(B - C) = AB - AC

Here is an example with numerical values:

>2(3x + 5) = 6x + 10

otherwise

>2(3x + 5) = 3x + 3x + 5 + 5 

or 

>2(3x) + 2(5)

A more complicated example would be:

>-3y + 4xy - 2x^2 + 2x + y^2 - 4xy + 2y + 3x^2

Simplifies to:

>-3y + 2y + 4xy - 4xy -2x^2 + 3x^2 + 2x + y^2

Simplifies to:

>-y +0xy + x^2 + 2x - y^2
