# Algebra Foundations

## Origins of Algebra

Algebra was documented for the first time in 820 AD by al-Kwarizmi in modern-day Afghanistan. The word 'algebra' translates to 'restoration' or 'completion'. Another translation for algebra is 'reunion of broken parts'. The document containing this information was known as the Al-Kitab al-mukhtasar fi hisab al-gab wa'l-muqabala - loosely translating to 'The book compendium of calculations, completion, and balancing'. 

There is also historical arguments that Diophantus of Alexandria created algebra in earlier times or that it was created by the ancient Babylonians as fat back as 2000 BC. Other historians will argue that Brahma Gupta of India created algebra around 600 AD.

### Abstraction

Abstraction is the concept of taking a tangible thing from reality and converting it into an idea. In the example of a sphere - there are real spheres that we can observe, and this can be represented by our concept and descriptions of what it means to be a sphere.

### Coordinate Plane

The coordinate plane is an abstract field where mathematical trends and observations can be depicted.

#### Rene Descartes

Rene Descartes (1596 - 1650) is most famous for 'I think; therefore I am.' Historically, most philosophers were also great mathematicians, and Rene is an example of this. He is the person that created the coordinate plane with x and y axes.

With is advent of the coordinate plane, Rene created an avenue for people to visually understand mathematical relationships. You could now represent this abstract concept in a more tangible way via geometry developed by Euclid.

The points that populate the coordinate plane are also known as cartesian coordinates. When these points are plotted on a cartesian plane, they generate a geometric shape that depicts all possible solutions for the plotted equation. Any point that falls on the lines generated will be a solution to the equation represented.

A less famous quote from Rene Descartes is 'You just keep pushing. You just keep pushing. I made every mistake that could be made, but I just kept pushing.'
