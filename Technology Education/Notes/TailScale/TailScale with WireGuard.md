# TailScale

### What is it?

#TailScale is a free #VPN service that connect all of your devices and applications within a secure private #subnet.  This allows for the creation of a peer-to-peer ( #P2P) mesh network known as a #tailnet.

#### What's Different?

Standard VPN services #encrypt all of the data before sending it through an encrypted network tunnel that routes through a #gateway server.

The biggest difference between standard VPN connections and tailnets is that a standard VPN must pass through a central gateway (concentrator?) that may not be close to the physical location of the user.  This means connecting to a node that is far away before establishing the connection to the intended destination.  

Tailnet systems avoid this centralization and allow for direct communication between devices, totally bypassing any concentrators or additional gateways. #Network configuration is handled by the app, bypassing any #router or #firewall without #port forwarding. As a result, TailScale facilitates lower #latency and higher #throughput. 

TailScale allows you to #SSH or #FTP into your own devices or access databases via #MagicDNS

### Who is it for?

TailScale is useful for both individuals and groups.  A #sysadmin could integrate existing Access Control Lists to allocate permissions across devices that staff uses.  Work-From-Home ( #WFH) workers will be able to securely access company resources without paying for a VPN service. A developer would be able to stage and test experimental #network configurations before implementation.  A home user would be able to #SSH into their own devices and route their traffic from public networks through an exit point on their home network.
