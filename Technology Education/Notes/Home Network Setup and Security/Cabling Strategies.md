Fully bare copper UTP cables are superior to CCA Copper Clad Aluminum cables. These cables are less flexible and more brittle, cannot be used PoE due to their high resistance and overheating tendencies. 
There are Solid and Stranded UTP connectors. In a Solid UTP connector, there aare 8 individual solid wires that connect t o8 conductors. Stranded UTP cables utilize multiple cables wound around each other, which increases flexibility and strength. 

For home use, solid cables of Cat6 or higher are preferred as they are more affordable and convenient for use with wall jacks. Stranded cables are better for distances shorter than 40 feet.

If you want to route cables through your HVAC system, you need to use cabling that is reinforced for use in a plenum system. These plenum rated cables reduce the propagation of fire to five feet or less.

Cat6 Rider cables are needed and used for behind drywall and under floors.

Get a 23AWG cable with solid bare copper connectors. These cables are thicker and are safer for use with Power Over Ethernet technology.
