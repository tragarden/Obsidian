# Smart Home Design

Smart Home technology is widely available and there are common solutions from major companies like #Google, #Apple, and #Amazon. While Alexa, Siri, and Google Home offer user friendly solutions for consumer Smart Home devices, they are quite lacking in automation options, which is often the 'smart' aspect of smart homes. These devices can be thought of as useful assistants to human input instead of automation devices.

With different technology like ZigBee and Z-Wave protocols, we can achieve a situationally intelligent system that is automated for seasonal changes, hourly programming, and conditional situations. An example of this would be your living room lights coming on and the blinds lowering at sunset, and when you turn on the television, these lights will dim. 

### Protocols

#Zigbee and #Z-Wave are protocols that facilitate automation and communication between devices. While they seem similar at face-value, they have different strengths and weaknesses. Luckily they can be used simultaneously, allowing you to use the best #protocol for each situation in your smart network.

These protocols work in conjunction with your Wi-Fi to create a mesh network that reduces the amount of device chatter on your wireless network. Wi-Fi is usually needed for more intensive devices like a thermostat and your hub, but most small devices can be managed by the other protocols. You can use both protocols and Wi-Fi from your hub device.

Mesh networks, or protocols, turn every device on the network into a node for transmission.  This means that the more devices you have within your network, the stronger the network signal becomes universally.

#Z-Wave only supports up to four devices, which is a major limiting factor of the protocol. If the signal path is unimpeded, this protocol can travel 300 feet. This protocol is more reliable than Zigbee, and has stronger signals and less interference. 

#Zigbee can support an unlimited amount of devices, allowing for a much larger mesh #network than Z-Wave. Disadvantages with Zigbee include limited range and operating on the 2.4GHz frequency, meaning it will encounter interference with your Wi-Fi network.  

A common strategy is to put all of your lights and wall plugs on one protocol, and any other devices on the other protocol, while keeping the hub and house thermostat on the Wi-Fi network. 

### Hubs

Smart Hubs are devices that support a wide range of protocols: Z-Wave, Zigbee, #Wi-Fi, #Bluetooth, #infrared, to name a few.  Lazy Admin suggests the Homey or Hubitat devices, as they support a wide range of devices and automation choices.
