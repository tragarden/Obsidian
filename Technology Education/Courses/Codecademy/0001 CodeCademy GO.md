# GO

#Golang ( #GO ) was developed by #Google to use for development of their own software. Go has become popular as a good intermediary between low-level and high-level languages. It is a great general purpose language that is fast, cross-platform, simple syntax similar to #C - it uses little memory and can be used for object-oriented tasks as well.
