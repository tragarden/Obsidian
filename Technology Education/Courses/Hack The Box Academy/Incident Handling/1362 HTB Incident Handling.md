# HTB Incident Handling

Incident Handling ( #IH) is a standard set of procedures implemented to respond to a security incident. is important for securing the three tenets of the #CIA Security Triad: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. There are many in-house solutions for incident handling as well as third-party options. 

In the context of incident handling, an event is any action that occurs across our #network. This means every mouse click, URL submission, key press, or action of a hardware device is considered an event in the scope of incident handling.

Now that we have defined events; an incident is an event that has a negative consequence. This could mean many things, for example unauthorized access or system failure. Although we can make this common observation, each organization will have their own definition of what they consider an incident to be. Whatever the incident may be, our goal is to identify it, quarantine it, remove it, and restore all of our systems back to working order as soon as possible.

It is strongly advised to have a dedicated incident handling team that can systematically and procedurally respond to a security incident promptly and efficiently. This team is vital for mitigating damage and addressing the incident immediately.

The incident response team will be headed by the incident manager - this role typically goes to the #SOC manager, #CISO, #CIO, or a third-party contractor. Their job is to document the incident and coordinate the employees responsible for addressing the incident. 

#NIST has a thorough guide to attain professional level incident reporting.
