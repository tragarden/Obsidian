# HTB Preparation Stage Part 1

There are two objectives of the *Preparation* stage - **developing an incident handling method** for the organization and **implementing protective measures**. Measures for protection include hardening the network devices, managing the active directory, *Multi-Factor Authentication* ( #MFA), access management, policies within the network, and many other methods. 

To establish and maintain our incident handling methods, we will need a **well-trained and well-educated staff** that is able to address problems as they arise in a methodical and professional way. This is accomplished through **implementation and awareness of organization policies** as well as the appropriate **hardware and software tools needed** for this role.

### Policy and Documentation

There is a need for **documentation about the incident handling process**, as well as active **documentation related to the incident**. 

There should be a ***defined set of rules and policies*** that will be followed any time an incident occurs. This should be **well-known by the staff and any third-parties** that work on incident handling. 

***Documenting the incident itself is equally or more important*** - although we are likely seeking a solution as fast as possible, it is vital to **remain calm and document the entire process**. You will want to note the discovery of the incident, who is working on it, what happened, what systems were impacted, what solutions were implemented, and which preventative measures were implemented for the future.

Here is the list of points worth documenting from HTB:

- Contact information for staff and legal team and roles of the staff
- Law enforcement contact information
- Incident response plan and policies
- Information sharing policy
- 'Golden Image' state of the environment
- System and network performance baselines
- #Network #Topology diagrams
- Asset management database
- Access to administrative accounts
- Bypassing of procurement process - emergency funds allocation
- Write-ups on how to preform network Forensics

The ***documentation for incidents should be kept separate from the organizations main network*** and data storage methods in the case that this too becomes compromised during attacks. This is ***to ensure that the incident reporting data is not able to be compromised in the same ways as the main network***.

### Tools and Jump Bag

It is vital to have a *Jump Bag* with all relevant tools and means of documenting the incident. ***This bag should always be accessible and complete*** - only being used during emergencies. We can consider the list of relevant tools that can perform the following tasks, suggested by HTB:

- Laptops or a forensic workstation for diagnoses and documentation.
- Forensic analysis tools
- Memory capture 
- Live response capture 
- Log analysis
- Network capture
- Network cables and switches
- Write blockers
- Hard drives
- Power cables
- Screwdrivers, Tweezers, other basic tools
- Indicator of Compromise ( #IOC) creator
- IOC search methods
- Chain of Custody forms
- Ticketing system
- Encryption software
- Secure storage and investigation
- Incident handling system independent from the organizations main network
