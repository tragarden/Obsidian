# Post-Incident Stage

The Post-Incident stage is where we review the entire scope of the incident and consider ways we can prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. This typically occurs after the final incident report is issues and is a reflection on what went wrong, how we remediated the incident, and what the final result was.

### Reporting

The reporting in this phase is more about how the team handled the incident and the general occurrence of incidents within the organization. These reports will document how the team responded, what policies were followed or implemented, and details about how efficiently the team worked. 

Some points that will be covered in the report include:

- What happened?
- When did it happen?
-  How did the team perform during this response?
- What were the plans, policies, and procedures used?
- How did the organization facilitate this response and could it be improved?
- How did we contain and eradicate the incident?
- What preventative measures were implemented?
- What tools and resources were used?
- What additional tools and resources could be used for prevention?
