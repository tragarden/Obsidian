# Incident Handling Process Overview

The process for handling incidents is defined in four stages by #NIST: Preparation, Detection and Analysis, Containment Eradication and Recovery, and Post-Incident Activity. 

#### Investigating and Recovering

Similar to the Cyber Kill Chain - this is not a linear process and there is a cyclical relationship between the Detection and Analysis stage and the Containment, Eradication, and Recovery stage. As soon as an incident is detected, we head to the containment phase. We will return to the Detection phase and back to the containment phase with each discovery.
