# Network Models

The #network models we use are known as the #OSI model and the #TCP/IP model.

### OSI

The Open Systems Interconnection ( #OSI) model is also known as the ISO/OSI layer model, which illustrates the means of communication between networks using seven layers. This was created by teamwork between the International Telecommunication Union ( #ITU) and the International Organization for Standardization ( #ISO).

### TCP/IP

Transmission Control Protocol / Internet  Protocol  ( #TCP/IP) are each a #protocol that facilitates the transmission of packets of data. The acronym is used as a generic term to include more than just these two protocols. #ICMP and #UDP fall under the umbrella of TCP/IP, which includes many other associated protocols.
