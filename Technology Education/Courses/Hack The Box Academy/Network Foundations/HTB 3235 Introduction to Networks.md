# Networks

A network is a system of interconnected devices that send and receive data to share resources.

Nodes are individual devices within the network.

Links are the ways nodes are connected, either wired or wireless.

Data Sharing is the primary intention of a network and enables data exchange.

Modem stands for Modulator-Demodulator.

# Network Concepts


The Open Systems Interconnection Model (OSI) is a standardized framework for illustrating telecommunication functions in an abstract way. It is comprised of seven layers:

1. Physical - physical medium used for transmission of data, like coaxial and ethernet cables.
2. Data Link - data transfer between each node that synchronizes frames while detecting errors and correcting them.
3. Network - routes and forwards packets through each destination throughout multiple networks.
