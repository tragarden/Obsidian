# Documentation and Reporting

Notetaking tools and organizational practices are pivotal skills in technology fields. Testing VMs and recording evidence, writing Executive Summaries, communicating to a range of audiences, documenting attack chains, and recording technical findings all require detailed and coherent notetaking skills. 

For penetration testing, the tester must create and portray a snapshot of the state of a network at the time they assess it. There will be an overview of the work performed, the technician that performed it, IP address lists, and technical details about the test. This should outline the testing period, duration, changes made, and vulnerabilities discovered.

Disclaimers and legal statements are usually included in these reports and agreements as well. The author will need to be able to write, interpret, and explain these agreements. 

#### Recovery

Documentation and records are important in the event of total loss. Sometimes a system will crash resulting in unrecoverable data and information. Backing up the testing process and procedures can allow the tester to restore the system to a previous state and then perform the tests again without much loss in time and efforts.

#### Liability

Having a detailed history of actions and work performed that aligns with a predefined and agreed upon scope can prevent liabilities and show how a tester operated within the agreed upon terms. The tester can demonstrate with evidence that they only performed tasks on devices and networks that were agreed upon by the client in a definitive way. In the case of an angry or accusatory client, you may be able to prove your innocence and avoid penalties or legal action.
