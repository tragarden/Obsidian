# Intro to Python 3

Python is one of the most popular scripting languages in current times. It is popular for use in automation and developing tools for IT related applications. In Information Security, Python is often implemented for Proof of Concepts ( #POC) and this is popular in penetration testing as well. It is popular due to it's easy readability and ability to be used for simple code writing.

Python is an interpreted language meaning that the code is not compiled into machine code. Python code is interpreted by the Python program before executing the scripts. This means that it is a high-level code and will not require memory management or system calls. In other words, this is a general purpose, multi-paradigm language with many applications that is simply implemented.

Python is an object-oriented language that uses key-value pairing to perform many of it's tasks.
