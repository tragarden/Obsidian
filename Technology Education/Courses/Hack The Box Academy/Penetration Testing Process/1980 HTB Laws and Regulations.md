# Laws and Regulations

There are many laws and regulations involved in pentesting that protect sensitive data that individuals have submitted to the internet or otherwise. An organization or a pentester will need to be aware of what these laws mean and ensure that they are working within the limits of the law to prevent legal prosecution or public dismay. Each country has established a set of laws for the protection of users and while they vary, many employ similar laws. 

Common laws implemented by USA, Europe, UK, India, and China cover the following ideas:

- Protecting Personal Data
- Protecting Infrastructure Information
- Criminalizing Malicious Acts using Computers
- Workarounds to access protected or copyrighted works
- Preventing interception of communications
- Protecting Health Data
- Regulating Data Collection from Children
- Cooperation between countries prosecuting cyber criminals
- Defining the rights and protections for personal data

### USA Laws and Regulations

- ##### Computer Fraud and Abuse Act ( #CFAA)
	- This act has been controversial since conception as it uses a lot of ambiguous language and lacks clarity. While it is intended to prosecute offenses related to hacking, identity theft, and malware distribution - many claim that this was an overreach of government authority and subsequently incriminated people who were unintentionally committing crimes related to the act.

- ##### Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( #DMCA)
	- This act was implemented to protect copyrighted materials from being accessed by unauthorized users. This means that it is illegal to circumvent any encryption or authentication protocols that protect digital content in the form of software, firmware, and digitally stored content.

- ##### Electronic Communications Privacy Act ( #ECPA)
	- This act makes it illegal to intercept any digital communications without consent from the sender and receiver. This means it is illegal to present intercepted communications in a court of law. A service provider is also not permitted to sell or disclose your information without your consent.

- ##### Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ( #HIPAA)
	- This act was created to regulate personal health information and related data that is stored by organizations. If an organization has your medical data, they must keep it encrypted, maintain a detailed list of access, and record any time they share a record.

- ##### Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ( #COPPA)
	- This act protects the data of anyone under the age of 13. Any organization that allows a child under the age of 13 will have to ensure they are not collecting or disclosing the personal information of a child in any way.

### European Laws and Regulations

- ##### General Data Protection Regulation ( #GDPR)
	- This regulation protects user rights involving their personal data. There are severe fines for violating these regulations which can be as high as 20 Millions Euros or 4% of annual revenue. 

- Network and Information Systems Directive ( #NISD)
	- This directive enforces all essential service providers to use strict security measures and report all security incidents.

- Cybercrime Convention of the Council of Europe
	- This convention is an international treaty for prosecuting cybercrime across multiple countries.


#### China, India, UK, and beyond

Please note that there are many more acts, laws, regulations, directives, and treaties across international lines. Including them is beyond the scope of what I feel like writing right now lol.
### Precautionary Measures for Pentesters

- Ensure that you have explicit permissions and consent from an authorized representative of the organization before performing a test of any kind.
- Do not exceed the scope of the work contract.
- Ensure that you do not damage the systems and networks you test.
- Do not view or disclose personal data without explicit permission.
- Do not intercept any communications without explicit consent.
- Take extra caution when working on networks involving #HIPPA related content. Make sure you have explicit consent before viewing or disclosing this data.
