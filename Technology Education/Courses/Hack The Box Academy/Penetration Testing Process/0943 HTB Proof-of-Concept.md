# Proof-of-Concept

#Proof-of-Concept ( #POC) is also known as Proof of Principle. This is a working prototype that parties can use to actively test a security flaw that has been identified by pentesters. 

The tester will create an automated method of replicating the attack they were able to successfully execute. This means providing a set of scripts and code to a client so they are able to repeat the attack we performed as many times as they need to find a remedy.

A problem with POC is that the client may just look for a way to prevent your scripts from running. While this effectively solves one weak point, the issue is that the client is not looking deeper into the problem and has only developed a surface level solution. It is vital to explain to a client that they will need to look for vulnerabilities beyond what our script is capable of.
