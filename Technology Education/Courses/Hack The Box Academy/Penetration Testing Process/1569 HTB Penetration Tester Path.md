# Penetration Testing Path

This module is the introduction to pursuing a Junior Penetration Tester path through the Hack The Box Academy. The goal of this pathway is to help testers develop well-rounded skills and their own method for implementing them. We will explore key concepts like External tests, Internal tests, and Web Application tests. We will refine skills in reconnaissance, enumeration, documentation, and simulated attacks on Virtual Machines ( #VM).

### Philosophy

A key concept this path will focus on is developing your own personal process and methodology that you can repeat on each case you work on. You will learn through repetition and failure - we will attack hundreds of modules and VMs which will instill a memory of the process over time.

### Ethics and Legality

It is ***VERY*** important to consider and remember the legal and ethical ramifications of penetration testing. We are actively getting permission from others to perform malicious and aggressive techniques against their networks - without a contract this is **EXPLICITLY ILLEGAL** and can certainly result in lawsuit and criminal trials if you go beyond the legal scope of your work. If you extend beyond the Scope of Work you may get yourself and related company in serious trouble, costing tons of money and legal headaches.

You will need to make sure that you ***FULLY UNDERSTAND*** your ***CONTRACT*** and ***SCOPE OF WORK***. If you feel like you will extend beyond the Scope of Work, ***ASK FOR PERMISSION AND GET IT IN WRITING***.

A key principal of penetration testing is to ***DO NO HARM***. You want to perform all of your testing in a controlled and respectful way. Only use the techniques required for the testing - if you ***DO NOT*** need a more powerful or destructive tool - ***DO NOT*** use them unless necessary for the scope of work.

Always be mindful and aware of the laws related to your work and be considerate about the ethical implications of the work you are performing.

***DOCUMENT YOUR WORK WITH TIMESTAMPS - CREATE A THOROUGH LOG OF ALL OF YOUR ACTIONS WITH TIME STAMPS. MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE DETAILED LOGGING THAT CAN ABSOLVE YOU OF GUILT IN CASE AN ATTACK OCCURS WHILE YOU ARE WORKING. ***

Being thorough and organized, taking notes, logging and documenting the process, communicating to the client and reporting - these are all key values for working in penetration testing.
