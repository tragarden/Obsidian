# Lateral Movement

Lateral Movement refers to accessing accounts with the same level of privilege that the hacked user account has. This means they all operate on the same plane of privilege and have similar security features ( or loopholes ). When we gain access to lateral movement within a network, this opens up new doors for us in terms of system control. At this stage you may be able to disable the entire network in a #ransomeware attack.

### Pivoting

#Pivoting or #Tunneling can be described as when a device that does not have direct access to the internet is accessed externally for exploitation. A great example of this is using an exploited host to abuse the print job system to compromise a local printer. We can now access a formerly inaccessible system through the compromised host.

#### Evasive Testing

After Lateral Movement is enabled, we will encounter a new level of security systems to evade. Threat monitoring will be different here, and #IPS, #IDS, #EDR, and network segmentation can all be methods employed against attackers. Understanding how these are configured and their capabilities is important for this phase.

#### Vulnerability Assessment

In this new phase of Vulnerability Assessment, emphasis will be on the rights of certain network components as well as the group policies that allow users to share information and files with each other. Gaining access to the 'Financial' group for an organization would be a huge threat.
