# Vulnerability Assessment

The Vulnerability Assessment phase occurs after each Information Gathering phase, where we analyze our newly discovered information. We use this phase to evaluate the discovered vulnerabilities, their origin, impact, remediation methods, and preventative measures we can take to harden our network.

There are four types of analysis we can perform during our Vulnerability Assessment:

- Descriptive analysis describes the individual characteristics of each data set we have gathered in order to find flaws in our collection methods.
- Diagnostic analysis determines the causes, effects, and interactions related to the discovered vulnerabilities.
- Predictive analysis provides insights about potential outcomes and the probability that they will occur. In this stage we will identify trends and outlier data to predict future issues.
- Prescriptive analysis determines methods for preventing future vulnerabilities.

During this phase it is important to pose questions about what we know to be true and any unknowns. In the example given, they provide the evidence revealed during an #nmap scan that #TCP #port 2121 is open. We can use this single port to determine some truths about what this means.

We know that this is a TCP connection from the start, thusly we can accurately say that this service is connection-oriented.

Furthermore we can see if this is a standard port. With minimal research we will find that standard ports range from 0-1023, so TCP port 2121 is clearly outside of this range. This is not a standard port assignment.

The example explains that we can compare this port number to similar numbers within the range of standard ports 0-1023. TCP port 21 is commonly used and facilitates #FTP transmissions.

After posing our investigative questions and thinking about what use of TCP port 2121 could mean, we can use a listener service such as #netcat or an #FTP client to observe activity on the port. 

During this scan we discover that the port has an unusually long response time - about 15 seconds. This is a common time allotted for FTP ports, so we can begin to draw conclusions that this port is likely being used for FTP related activities.

We can use the following command with nmap to confirm our findings:

>probe round trip time --min-rtt-timeout

#### Research and Analysis

During our Vulnerability Research phase we will seek out known vulnerabilities related to the versions and services running on the hosts. We can search for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ( #CVE) in various databases to determine exploits and flaws in security.

Once we have determined a known vulnerability by its #CVE documentation, we can exploit this vulnerability and incorporate it into our Proof-of-Concept ( #POC).

#### The Return

The Return is a reference to returning to the Information Gathering phase after exhausting our efforts in the Vulnerability Assessment phase. All testers will alternate back and forth between these two phases **many** times during a thorough test. You will likely discover a little, assess vulnerabilities, exploit them, and gain a little more access. Then you will need to gather information about your new level of access. This cycle will repeat until the tester is confident they have uncovered all active vulnerabilities.
