# Penetration Testing Process

A process in the context we are focusing on is the sequence of events needed to complete work, run a business, manage a production facility, or creating value. Additionally this often refers to lightweight programs that run in the background of software.

In the case of penetration testing specifically, a process is the succession of steps made by a penetration tester to develop a pathway to a given objective.

A #deterministic process is one that is dependent on the cause and effect of previous events and states of the process.

A #stochastic process relies more on the probability of a process occurring after a different process has happened prior.

Processes are not fixed and can change dependent on the environment they are applied within. 

#### TTP

Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures ( #TTP) are the different processes performed at different stages of our penetration tests. These may be completed only once, but oftentimes we repeat steps in a process many times. Pillaging and Lateral Movement are both steps that will likely be performed many times during a single penetration test.

### Notes on Pre-Engagement

During the pre-engagement stage there are a few items that are managed during this time. For some reason this was not thoroughly covered in the previous modules. These  key items include:

- Non-Disclosure Agreement ( #NDA)
- Goals and Objectives of the Pentest
- Scope of the Work Performed
- Estimated Time to Completion
- Rules of Engagement for the Pentester
