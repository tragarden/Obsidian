# Practice 

There are so many facets of pentesting to practice that we can be increasing our knowledge, skills, and speed at any time. Even keyboard practice is a great way to be a better tester.

#### Modules

It is recommended that you complete a mix of technical and offensive modules, and in many cases you will do the module a second time while you also take notes. After a given module, doing the related machines is an important way to cement your knowledge. HTB recommends doing 3 retired VMs, 5 active VMs, followed by a pro lab or endgame module.

#### Documentation

You will need to gain skills in creating both technical and non-technical documentation. The non-technical documentation will be more accommodating for any laymen that want to understand what you are doing. This will use common vocabulary in place of pentesting and networking jargon.
