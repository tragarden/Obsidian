# Pentesting Overview

A Penetration Test ( #Pentesting) is a series of tests performed under contract to examine and evaluate a network for an organization. These tests simulate an actual attack using a variety of methods that cyber criminals employ. 

### Consent

These tests are performed with explicit permission from the organization and if performed well will uncover vulnerabilities in the network. Knowledge of these vulnerabilities allow the organization to secure their own confidentiality and availability of their network.

### Duties and Scope

Pentesting falls under the category of Risk Management as it is used to identify and mitigate threats and risk within the network. Eliminating vulnerabilities is paramount in securing the organizations data and functionality.

While the goal of pentesting is to identify vulnerabilities - it is not the responsibility of the pentesters to remedy these problems. Rectifying any vulnerabilities or flaws in security is the duty of the client - pentesting is only the method of finding out the flaws, not correcting them or hardening security.

### Manual Discovery and Automation

Pentests include manual assessment of vulnerabilities as well as automated scanning of threats. While automation is useful for collecting a lot of data quickly, most of the information gathering should be performed manually as this is a more thorough exploration into the systems in question.

### Permissions

We need to seek explicit permission from an organization before performing any kind of penetration test. When working within an organization you will find that there are many third parties involved in the function of this organization. This means that while the client may permit your testing, third parties may not have consented to the testing. This means that your client will need to contact all of their third party providers and request their consent about testing. If a third party were to deny consent, this would limit the scope of our testing in order to operate under legal and ethical practice.
### Confidentiality

While conducting penetration tests we will invade the privacy of all users on the network. We will see Personally Identifying Information ( #PII) like addresses, salaries, full names, credit card information, and many other items depending on the organization. Working with a hospital may expose you to the private data of thousands of people. When considering the privacy of our clients, we should review and remember the [Data Protection Act](https://www.gov.uk/data-protection "data protection act) to ensure we are operating legal and ethical practices.

### Types of Pentesting

There are a variety of methods, situations, and environments for pentesting which means there are myriad ways in which we can test these networks. 

#### External

External pentests indicate that the tester is operating from outside the organization, imitating the role of an anonymous internet user trying to gain unauthorized access. This means that the test originates from outside of the network we are testing, and tests would seek vulnerabilities for entry into this network.

#### Internal

Internal pentests occur after a pentester has gained unauthorized access to a network, or if the organization provided means of entry before the test even began. This is useful if a company is well secured against external threats but is susceptible to problems within their network. This is also the case for any #LAN networks that are not connected to the greater #WAN. 

#### Blackbox

Blackbox testing is typically an external test where the client yields little to no information about the network we are examining. If information is provided, it will be bare minimum data such as IP addresses or domains.

#### Graybox

Grayboxing is an extension of blackbox testing that provides slightly more information allowing the tester to focus on a specific issue or gain escalated credentials more easily. This allows testers to examine the network for vulnerabilities from a higher level of privilege.

#### Whitebox

Whitebox testing means that the client has fully disclosed all known information about a network so the pentester can examine every facet possible during their test. The tester will be able to examine every individual structure within the network while possessing maximum administrator credentials, access to source code, and detailed configuration settings for all hardware, Active Domain, web applications, and native software.

#### Red-Team

Red-Teaming indicates an offensive or aggressor role during penetration testing. This role will include attacking the target with aggressive tools by any means possible to gain unauthorized access to data and credentials. This can lead beyond the network to social engineering analysis and testing of physical hardware.

#### Purple-Team

Purple-Teaming still employs red-team strategies, but focuses more on the defensive aspects of the network. This means finding vulnerabilities and offering relative solutions to defending against them.

### Environments

HTB has included a list of possible environments that a pentester may work within. The following is a list of environments a tester may work on, or any given combination of the following:

- #Network
- Web Applications
- #IoT 
- Hosts
- #Cloud 
- Mobile
- Server
- Source Code
- Policies
- #API 
- Physical security
- Firewalls
- Clients
- Employees and Staff
