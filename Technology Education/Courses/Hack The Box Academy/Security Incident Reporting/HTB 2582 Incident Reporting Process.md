# Incident Reporting Process

Having a clear procedure for incident reporting streamlines the process for all team members involved and documents the incidents on a case by case basis that can be reviewed in the future and returned to if such problems should arise again. The reporting process can be broken down into seven key steps that organize the procedure in a linear fashion.

### 1. Initial Detection

Detection and acknowledgement of an incident is the first stage of the process - we can't begin reporting if we didn't know an incident occurred! These events may be detected automatically through security tools or via human observation. In the worst case scenario we will not know until the threat actor has executed malicious acts on our network.

### 2. Preliminary Analysis

Our first stage of analysis will determine the severity of the threat and the consequences associated with it. We can classify threats based on the following metrics:

- Critical ( #P1) - a severe threat that jeopardizes the entire network and possible the enterprise.
- High ( #P2) - a threat to operations that is not of immediate concern but needs prioritization.
- Medium ( #P3) - threats that don't jeopardize the operations but warrant attention.
- Low ( #P4) - routine incidents that occur with standard operational procedures.

### 3. Incident Logging

Every parameter and metric related to the incident should be thoroughly logged in an organized way. Methods for logging these events could be paper ledgers or spreadsheets, although frameworks like #JIRA and #TheHiveProject are preferred. 

### 4. Notification of Parties

Any party that may be affected by these events needs to be notified reasonably soon after discovery. 

Internal parties would include the #IT department, legal team, Public Relations, and company executives. If the event is severe, the entire organization may need to be notified.

External parties would include customers, partners, regulatory bodies, and at times the general public. These parties are notified in worst case scenarios.

### 5. Investigation and Reporting

A detailed technical analysis that investigates and described the impact of the incident is crucial. This may take days or years depending on the severity and range of the incident and the amount of information that needs to be reported on. 

### 6. Final Report

This is a thorough and complete documentation of the incident that can be issued to all regulators, insurance providers, and organization executives in both laymen and technical terms. It will reveal the origin of the threat, affectations, and the remediation methods that were needed. Future prevention methods should be detailed as well.

### 7. Feedback Loop

This is a review of the incident that prepares and protects against future incidents. Analyzing the incident a second time helps us prevent future incidents and identifies weak points in our current system.

### Conclusion

This process is an asset and increases resilience and understanding throughout the entire organization. We can improve the security presence of the organization while turning a bad situation into a experience of growth.
