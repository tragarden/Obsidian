# Security Incident Communications

### Reasons for Communications

- Stakeholder trust - shows that the organization is responsible and transparent with the stakeholders.
- Efficiency - aligns all parties affected by the incident and keeps teams coordinated.
- Regulatory Compliance - cross-verify that the organization complied with all regulations as detailed in the Incident Response Plan ( #IRP).

### Internal Communications

- Immediate Notifications - notifying stakeholders with a sense of urgency so they are involved in the process and don't find out about the incident through a third party. 
- Regular Updates - periodic briefings that keep all teams informed and involved in the process and aware of current or pending ramifications.
- Feedback Loop - allows teams to exchange ideas and findings as well as voice their concerns and suggestions. 

### External Communications

External communications refers to dissemination of information to third parties such as customers, regulatory agencies, and government.

- Affected parties - ALL affected parties should be aware of the incident, such as customers, clients, and partners.
- Public Statement - for major incidents, a laymen statement addressed to a broad audience should be presented for customers and third parties.
- Regulatory Bodies - you may face obligation to inform agencies like the Information Commissioner's Office ( #ICO).

### Navigating Communication Channels

It is important to use the correct channels to communicate that the organization remains in compliance.

#### Security Dimensions

- Encryption - end-to-end encryption is required to maintain data integrity so that outside sources are not able to see the current vulnerabilities and methods employed to exploit the network.
- Authentication and Authorization - using Multi-Factor Authentication ( #MFA) to ensure that our channels of communication are secured and outsiders are not able to obtain this data.
- Data Integrity - data must remain unaltered during transmission using cryptographic hashing.
- Ephemeral Communications - using messages that automatically destruct after a user reads them.
- Air-Gapped Communications - isolating communications to secure networks while avoiding networks that are potentially compromised.

#### Regulatory Dimensions

- Data Privacy Laws - making sure we are in compliance about transmission of personal data.
- Breach Notification Mandates - adhering to guidelines and timelines for reporting breaches. 
- Record-Keeping - maintaining a clear record of incident-related communications to remain within compliance standards.
- Cross-Border Communications - observing data sovereignty laws when communicating internationally.
- Chain of Custody - maintaining an unbroken chain of custody for evidence to remain within legal precedents, otherwise our evidence may be admissible in a court of law.
