# Authentication Protocols

#Kerberos is a Key Distribution Center ( #KDC) authentication protocol that uses a ticket system.

Secure Remote Password ( #SRP) prevents eavesdropping and #MITM attacks on transmissions.

Secures Sockets Layer ( #SSL) secures and encrypts communications on a #network.

Transport Layer Security ( #TLS) provides encrypted communications over the internet and is the successor to #SSL.

#OAuth an open standard allowing for third-parties to be authorized to access without a password.

#OpenID uses decentralized authentication to sign into multiple websites with a single login.

Security Assertion Markup Language ( #SAML) facilitates authentication and authorization with an #XML standard.

Two-Factor Authentication ( #2FA) uses two factors to verify a user.

Fast Identity Online Alliance ( #FIDO) is a group of companies working together to develop authentication standards.

Public Key Infrastructure ( #PKI) uses public and private keys for digital signatures and securing data.

Single Sign-On ( #SSO) uses a single set of credentials to access multiple resources.

Multi-Factor Authentication ( #MFA) uses multiple methods to verify a user.

Password Authentication Protocol ( #PAP) transmits a user's password across a network in plaintext.

Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol ( #CHAP ) uses a three-way handshake to verify a user.

Extendible Authentication Protocol ( #EAP) is a framework supporting multiple methods of authentication.

Secure Shell ( #SSH) forms an encrypted connection with another computer so they can directly communicate and share resources.

Hyper-text Transfer Protocol Secure ( #HTTPS) is used to obscure data from attackers that may intercept it and is the secure version of #HTTP.

Lightweight Extensible Authentication Protocol ( #LEAP) is a proprientary wireless authentication method from #CISCO that uses the #RC4 encryption algorithm. This is relatively insecure and vulnerable to dictionary attacks. 

Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol ( #PEAP) is a secure version of EAP technology and uses TLS to encrypt data sent to a server. A server-side certificate is used to verify users.

LEAP and PEAP are commonly used in conjunction with VPNs because SSH and HTTPS are not easily used within the VPN.
