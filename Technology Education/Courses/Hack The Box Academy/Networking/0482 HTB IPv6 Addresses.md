# IPv6 Addresses

#IPv6 is the newer standard the replaced IPv4 addressing although IPv4 is still the most commonly used of the two protocols. These addresses are 128 bits long with a prefix that identifies hosts and pathing. These addresses are assigned by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority ( #IANA).

IPv6 was created to make more IP addresses available, since the total available IPs for IPv4 was reaching terminal volume. Other improvements include self-configuration of addresses ( #SLAAC), multiple addresses per interface, 4BG packages, end-to-end encryption, and faster routing. #IPSec also became mandatory with the advent of IPv6.

It is important to note that IPv6 uses SLAAC and DHCPv6 instead of DHCP.

#Dual-stack is when you use IPv4 and IPv6 simultaneously. An interface can have a variety of IPv6 addresses in conjunction with an IPv4 address. 

There are multiple types of IPv6 addresses, described in terms of casting. 

#Unicast is addressing for one interface.

#Anycast is addressing for multiple interfaces with only one active recipient. 

#Multicast is addressing for multiple interfaces with all active recipients.

#Broadcast is synonymous as Multicast in this instance.
