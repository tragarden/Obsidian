# OSI Model

### What is the OSI Model?

The Open Systems Interconnection ( #OSI) model was created to represent the methods of communication between different protocols and hardware across a #network. In other words, it differentiates the actions of a #router from activity on your #coaxial cable via a hierarchical model with seven layers. Each layer represent a different phase of communication, #protocol, or #hardware type.

OSI works with a hierarchy of different layers that perform very specific duties and have logic for interacting with the layers directly above and below. For every communication between two devices, all seven layers of the OSI model will be involved two times - once by the sender and once by the receiver. 

### Seven Layers

7. #Application provides application functions and controls input/output.
6. #Presentation takes information from your system-specific applications data and converts it to a more universal format.
5. #Session manages the logical connections between systems and troubleshoots connection issues.
4. #Transport controls the transferring data, segmenting and monitoring the data to detect and prevent congestion of traffic across the network.
3. #Network transmits data across the network, forwarding packets in #packet-switched networks and forming connections within a #circuit-switched network.
2. #DataLink examines the network traffic to ensure reliable transmission without error, dividing data from layer 1 into frames.
1. #Physical submits transmissions to a wireless or wired network via electric pulses.
