# Cryptography

### Encryption

Encryption is a method of obfuscating data so that outsiders cannot decipher it. Cryptography has changed a lot over the years, and usually only the most current standards are truly secure. There are both symmetric and asymmetric methods for encrypting data.

#### Symmetric Encryption

Symmetric Encryption uses a secret key to encrypt and decrypt data. This type of encryption is often employed for large sets of data and often use Advanced Encryption Standard ( #AES) and Data Encryption Standard ( #DES). AES is the most secure standard in 2023.

#### Asymmetric Encryption

Asymmetric Encryption uses two distinctly different keys: a public and private key. The public key is used to encrypt any given data - but this data cannot be decrypted unless the user has the private key as well. Examples of this style include Rivest-Shamir-Adleman ( #RSA), Pretty Good Privacy ( #PGP), and Elliptic Curve Cryptography ( #ECC). Asymmetric Encryption offers greater security than symmetric.
