# Layer 3: Network

Layer 3 of the #OSI model is known as the #Network Layer. This layer identifies nodes within the network, clears channels to ensure stable connections, and monitors the routing of #packet flow across the network. This layer receives addresses and builds the routing tables.

This layer mainly deals with logical addressing and routing across a variety of protocols, including #IPv4, #IPv6, #IPsec, #ICMP, #IGMP, #RIP, #OSPF, and many more.
