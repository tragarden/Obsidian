# TCP/IP Model

Transmission Control Protocol ( #TCP) and Internet Protocol ( #IP) are commonly combined and known as the Internet Protocol Suite. The role of these protocols in regard to the OSI model means IP is within the #Network Layer 3 and TCP occurs within the #Transport layer 4.

While OSI separates into seven individual layers, TCP/IP combines some of these layers into a four layer system.  Layers 5-7 of the OSI model get rolled into a single layer: Layer 4 #Application. Layers 1-2 get rolled into a single layer: Layer 1 #Link.

#### Four Layers

4. #Application 
3. #Transport
2.  #Internet
1. #Link 

### IP

Internet Protocol ( #IP) is a #protocol that manages logical addressing and routing within your network, ensuring that any #packet on the network goes to its intended destination and nowhere else. This protocol deals with classes, subnetting, and #CIDR.

### TCP

Transmission Control Protocol ( #TCP) is used to control traffic and monitor it for errors, as well as offer support for the applications using TCP and #UDP.
