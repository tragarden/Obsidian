This is often used to link multiple locations together, allowing for them to communicate and share resources as if they were on a single local network.

#### Remote Access VPN

Remote Access VPNs are when a virtual interface is created on the client device to performs as if it is on the client's network. For HackTheBox, #OpenVPN is used to make a #TUN Adapter that allows for access to the labs. 

#Split-tunnel VPNs are used to contain the internet connection within the VPN, and the VPN is only creating routes between specific networks.

#### SSL VPN

An #SSL VPN is a feature of some browsers that can stream your desktop or applications to the browser. This is implemented on HackTheBox via the Pwnbox. 

### GAN

Global Area Networks ( #GAN) is what is known to people as the worldwide internet.  These networks use industrial hardware and are connected via undersea fiber-optic cabling and satellite technology. 

### MAN

Metropolitan Area Networks ( #MAN) is composed of several large LANs using #broadband communications within a region. These networks utilized leased lines, fiber-optic transmissions, and high-performance routers.

### PAN and WPAN

(Wireless) Personal Area Network ( #WPAN / #PAN) are used to connect personal devices such as phones, laptops, tablets, cars, #IoT devices, and many more things. They may be hard-wired via #ethernet, however most of these devices have wireless capabilities utilizing #Bluetooth and #USB Wireless.

A #piconet is the WPAN generated when items are connected via #Bluetooth.
