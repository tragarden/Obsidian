# Starting

HackTheBox and HackTheBox Academy are similar but distinctly different methods of learning that should be used side-by-side to develop two types of learning: guided learning and exploratory learning.

#### Guided

Guided learning indicates that there is an obvious list of tasks and concepts to read about before attempting the strategies discussed via step-by-step modules that guide you the whole way through. This is the method of HTB Academy - you read about a topic and then apply the concepts learned through the narrow scope of a specific set of tasks.

#### Exploratory

Exploratory learning is an open ended method that doesn't provide obvious tasks for completion and let's the user apply skills they have learned until they discover things on their own. They are given little to no direction and must interact and make attempts until they discover the answer in hiding. This is the method of HTB - you will attack a #VM with little to no hints or clues about what you are attacking or looking for. All enumeration and vulnerability detection is up to you to discover, practice, and employ.

### Practice and Study

#### Virtual Machines

There are a variety of options for vulnerable attack targets for you to practice on. These are typically Virtual Machines ( #VM) that are set up with the explicit purpose of simulating vulnerabilities for a range of hardware, software, operating systems, and applications. 

Some examples of these vulnerable VMs include #OWASP Juice Shop, Metasploitable, and DVWA.

#### YouTube

HTB lists YouTube as a great resource for learning pentesting. They include the following channels in their recommendations:

- [IppSec](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa6eh7gCkpPo5XXUDfygQQA "walkthroughs for retired HTB modules")
- [VbScrub](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpoyhjwNIWZmsiKNKpsMAQQ "HTB guide videos")
- [STOK](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQN2DsjnYH60SFBIA6IkNwg "infosec channel on YT")
- [LiveOverflow](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClcE-kVhqyiHCcjYwcpfj9w "infosec youtube channel")

#### Blogs

There are many blogs available to check out and learn from. It may even be beneficial for you to create your own blog to document your progress and make your process available to third parties that can offer their own input or learn from your posts. HTB only makes one recommendation of a must-see blog: [Oxdf hacks stuff](https://0xdf.gitlab.io/ "blog about HTB modules and hacking").

#### Tutorials

There are many forms of tutorials on the internet, but for relevance to hack the box related work we should look at tutorials that teach the Command Line ( #CLI) for #Bash and #PowerShell. [Under The Wire](https://underthewire.tech/wargames "Under the wire shell tutorials")and [Over The Wire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/ "Over The Wire shell tutorials")are the tutorial sites recommended by HTB.

#### HTB Starting Point

HTB Starting Point is the introduction module for beginning HTB modules. It will introduce you to the basic concepts and skills required for hacking the modules. This is a good way to introduce yourself to exploratory learning practices.
