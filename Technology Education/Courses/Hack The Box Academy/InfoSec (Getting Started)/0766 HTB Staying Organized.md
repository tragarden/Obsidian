# Staying Organized HTB  
  
The main consideration for organization is to document progress and changes in clear way that ourselves and others can interpret and understand.  
  
It is common to use note taking applications in conjunction with pentesting. Some examples include Notepad++, Evernote, GitBook, Notion, VScode, and SublimeText.  
  
Markdown language is useful for creating uniform notes that can be exported to applications that can read markdown language and use it for stylizing your notes within the app.  
  
Having your own personal databasee for your personal notes and guides on how to perform specific tasks. Having these available in your own words is very useful when you are troubleshooting or applying a skill you don't use too often.  
  
Having an aggreggate folder for all the commands, vulnerabilities, and applications we use is necessary for navigating confusing waters in the future. Additionally you can create templates and checklists, ensuring that you've done everything thoroughly.  
  
HTB suggests downloading the cheat sheets for each module and including them in your notes!!
