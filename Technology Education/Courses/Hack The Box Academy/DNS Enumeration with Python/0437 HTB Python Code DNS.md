# Python Code

Code revision and editing for clarity can save many hours of lost time and confusion, resulting in high pressure situations and rushed results. The more implemented functions, the more challenging code management becomes. Poor change managemenet and lack of explanatory comments can result in chaos and new errors as more modifications are implemented trying to remedy confusing code. 

When committed to repositories, the branches can become difficult to manage and many confusing splits in the Version Control System ( #VCS) can occur, which hinders all development efforts. This will result in more resources consumed by the project and developers that are occupied with error corrections and debugging. Ultimately this could result in vulnerabilities and myriad problems. 

### Guidelines


| Guideline                    | Description                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Unique Nomenclature          | variables should use consistent, meaningful, unique, and pronouncible names that clearly identify them. |
| Avoid Errors in Construction | Avoid heavily nested statements and design control statements in an easy way.                           |
| One Task per Function        | Each function performs ONE task.                                                                        |
| Do NOT Duplicate Lines       | Duplicating lines results in complicated and large code blocks.                                         |
| Small amount of Arguments    | Fewer arguments facilitates understanding of functions, resulting in less errors and easier debugging.  |

### PEP8

Python Enhancement Proposal ( #PEP8) is a set of guidelines and best practices for writing Python code, created by Guido van Rossum, Varry Warsaw, and Nick Coghlan in 2001. Their intention was to help Python developers improve readability and consistency of code for collaboration and clarity purposes.

#### PEP8 Guidelines


| Guideline          | Description                       |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Indenation         | 4 spaces, no tabs                 |
| Max Line Length    | 79 characters per line            |
| Max Comment Length | 72 characters per line            |
| Encoding           | UTF-8 for Python 3                |
| Quotes             | Decide on single or double quotes |
