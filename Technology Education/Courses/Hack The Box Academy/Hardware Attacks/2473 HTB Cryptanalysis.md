# Cryptanalysis

Cryptanalysis is the act of breaking ciphertext, cyphers, and cryptosystems. It is the process of decrypting encrypted data without access to encryption keys.

The following techniques are used to break a cryptographic system:

- Frequency Analysis - uses pattern recognition and statistical analysis to determine the frequency of characters in the ciphertext and compare them to frequency of letters in plain text language. Once substitution or transposition patterns are discovered, decoding is possible.

- Pattern Finding - groups of characters or patterns are recognized in the ciphertext and comparisons for plain text segments are discovered accordingly. 

- Brute Force - all possible keys are tried until the correct one is discovered. This is an impractical and resource dependent method.

### History

Foundations of cryptanalysis are found in Egypt in 1900 BC via non-standard hieroglyphs. Greeks later used a Scytale to transpose ciphers and hide messages.

The first recorded evidence of this came from Al-Kindi who wrote a book on decryption which included the first documented instance of frequency analysis.

Italian Giovanni Battista della POrta wrote De Furtivis Literarum Notis (On the Hidden Notes of Letters) during the Renaissance period. 

In World War II, the German Enigma machine code was broken by Alan Turing's team.
