# Front-end and Back-end

Front-end refers to the components directly accessed by the client through the web browser. This is the images displayed, the user interface ( #UI), the user experience ( #UE), and all associated #HTML, #CSS, and #JavaScript. They are usually optimized to work on any sized screen and many different operating systems. Sometimes when a user is experiencing a slow internet connection or think the web server is being slow - is actually a fault of their own browser on the client side of things.

Back-end refers to the server side of the equation where processes are run to facilitate the action on the front-end. Without a back-end, a website is just a set of static documents.

Back-end Servers are the hardware that host all components, operating systems, and containers. 

Web servers manage HTTP submissions and replies. Examples include #Apache, #NGINX, and #ITS.

Databases ( #DB) manage the web application data and allow authorizes sources to access these resources. Examples include #MySQL, #Oracle, and #Postgre. 

Development frameworks help developers build their servers and systems.
