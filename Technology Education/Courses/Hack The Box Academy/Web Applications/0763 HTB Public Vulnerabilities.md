# Public Vulnerabilities

Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ( #CVE) is a collection of patched vulnerabilities with relevant information like threat level, type of attack, and summary of how it affected clients and the internet. 

Common Vulnerability Scoring System ( #CVSS) is a #FOSS standard for documenting security vulnerabilities provided by the National Security Database ( #NVD). These scores are evaluated on the metrics of Base, Temporal, and Environmental factors. The Temporal and Environmental factors are analyzed to generate the base score.

It is important to consider that there are two different rating systems for these scores: CVSS V2.0 and CVSS V3.0. The scoring of these two systems will be different. 

There is also a CVSS score calculator that you can use to assess your own threat levels and see how the formulas are used to generate the scores.
