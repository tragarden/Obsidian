# HTML

HyperText Markup Language ( #HTML ) is the fundamental code used to run every website.

Note #URL encoding is a part of using HTML because without this, most URLs and links will not load. This means that certain symbols cannot be correctly represented by your browser and instead you must use #ASCII encoding with percent signs. An example is ( ! ) being represented by the expression %21.

An #element in HTML is anything contained within a start and end tag, indicated by the characters < and >. 

Each element in HTML code is a Document Object Model ( #DOM).

DOMs are language-neutral interfaces that allow for the modification of a document.

- Core DOMs apply to all document types.
- XML DOMs are for XML files.
- HTML DOMs are for HTML files.

# CSS

Cascading Style Sheets ( #CSS) is a stylesheet language used in conjunction with #HTML to stylize and improve the appearance of an HTML file.

# JavaScript

#JavaScript is used to control the functions of a web page to make it dynamic and interactive. It works in conjunction with HTML and CSS on the front-end, although it has back-end applications as well. When you see a button rendered, this is JavaScript at work. 

JS can be used to automate processes, create animations, update web pages, update content within the page, process user input, and perform HTTP requesting.

Common JS frameworks include: #Angular, #React, #Vue, and #jQuery.
