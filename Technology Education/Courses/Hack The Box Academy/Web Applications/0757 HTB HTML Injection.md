# HTML Injection

#HTML injection is when an attacker submits HTML code into prompts that accept user input. This may change the appearance or operation of the code in question. This is similar to Cross-Site Scripting ( #XSS). 

To prevent input prompts from becoming compromised, you must implement sanitation methods in order to limit the text that may be submitted via input boxes.
