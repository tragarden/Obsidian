# Databases

A Database is used to store the data related to all aspects of the web application. Speed, size, scalability, and cost are important factors to consider when you are choosing a database.

Relational databases are known as #SQL databases, which store data in a table format of rows and columns. This is then used to create relationships between different tables. This relationship is known as a #schema. This is useful when attempting to access all data related to a specific object. You can see the associations of this object with all tables within the database at once.

Non-relational databases are known as #NoSQL lacks a defined architecture and relies on models for storage instead of tables with rows and columns. They are useful to employ upon sets of data that lack a defined structure, enabling a very scalable and flexible structure. There are several types:
- Key-Value
- Document-Based
- Wide-Column
- Graph
