# Web Server

Web Servers are responsible for the routing and management of HTTP requests and issuing responses. These operate on port 80 and port 443. Additionally these servers handle text, binary data, and image files such as JSON.

#Apache ( #httpd) is a #FOSS server architecture used to host more than 40% of the worlds websites. Apache is native to Linux and available for macOS and windows. Apache developers typically use the #PHP language, but .NET, Python, Perl, and Bash are commonly used as well. Modules can be added to the apache interface to support these languages and more.

#NGINX is a #FOSS server architecture that hosts 30% of the worlds websites, although it is used by more than half of the top most accessed websites. It is light-weight and uses less RAM and CPU resources while maintaining strong security and reliability.

#Microsoft Internet Information Services ( #IIS) hosts about 15% of the world's sites, although a large portion of these are enterprise endeavors that are integrated with Active Domain and deeply reliant on this. Typically this runs on Windows Server using the .NET framework, although exceptions exist.
