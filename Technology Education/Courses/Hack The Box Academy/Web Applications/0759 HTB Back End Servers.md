# Back End Servers

These servers support all functions of the application and operate on the Data Access layer. A back-end server is composed of three core elements:

- A web server that hosts the web application and interacts with the database.
- A database that stores all data related to the app and client credentials.
- A Development Framework that allows developers to modify the application and create new aspects.
- Hypervisors, containers, and any #WAF will also be included in these components.

The combination of these three components can be referred to by common setups with acronyms such as #LAMP, #WAMP, #WINS, #MAMP, and #XAMPP. In this case, LAMP stands for "Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP". These are known as a Web Solution #Stack.
