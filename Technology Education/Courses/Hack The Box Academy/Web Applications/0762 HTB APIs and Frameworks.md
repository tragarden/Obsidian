# APIs

Application Programming Interface ( #API) is an interface within a web application that defines the rules of engagement with HTTP protocol, remote access of resources, and communication with other applications. 

Simple Objects Access ( #SOAP) is a standard based on #XML language being sent via #HTTP requests to facilitate communication between front and back-end. It works well with structured data, serial communications, and #stateful objects. SOAP has a strong learning curve and is not easily implemented.

Representational State Transfer ( #REST) is a standard based on #JSON format and is an easier API to configure and use than SOAP.
