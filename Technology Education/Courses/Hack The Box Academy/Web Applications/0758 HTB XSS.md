# XSS

XSS is a more powerful version of HTML injection where the attacker uses JavaScript to attack the client side. There are three types:
- Reflected XSS - when user input is displayed on the page after rendering the XSS related code.
- Stored XSS - when information stored in the database is displayed.
- DOM XSS is when user input is written to an HTML DOM item.
