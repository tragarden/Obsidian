# Interacting with Host Security Teams

After submitting a report to a Bug Bounty Program, it is important to be patient while the security team reviews your report and attempts triage methods. Wait for them to validate your report and get back to you with questions or other responses. 

Sometimes you will be provided with a timeframe by which these organizations intend to respond by. In other words - DO NOT spam the team while they are processing and responding to your report.

If the team has not responded to you within a reasonable amount of time, you should contact their [Mediation](https://docs.hackerone.com/hackers/hacker-mediation.html 'contact the mediation department') department for more information.

### Post-Response

After the team responds to your report, document the response for your own records. Note team member names and usernames so you can tag them in future correspondences. Use only official channels of communication as this is a professional endeavor and should remain that way.

If you experience disagreements with the security team, there are methods for responding in a professional way. Proper methods of conduct include:

- Explain your reasoning for scoring a vulnerability a certain way and find a point of compromise between your point of view and theirs.
- Review the program's scope and policy to make sure you are within compliance for the expectations of the program.
- If you do not feel like a fair compromised has been reached, contact Mediation services to state your case.
