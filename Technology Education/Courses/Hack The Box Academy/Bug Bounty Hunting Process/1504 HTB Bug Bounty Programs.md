# Bug Bounties

Bug Bounty Programs ( #BBP), also known as Vulnerability Disclosure Program ( #VRP), are crowdsourced initiatives where individuals discover and report software bugs. This is continuous testing performed on web applications that is a form of proactive security testing to insure that external threat actors are unable to penetrate the defenses of a website or application. 

[HackerOne](https://www.hackerone.com/ 'bug bounty site for jobs') is a site that can be used to find bug bounty programs to participate in.

There are several types of programs:

- Private - these are invite-only programs that are initially implemented to discover the majority of the bugs before exposing the product to a mass audience. Eventually these will be presented to the public once the list of vulnerabilities is reduced. Invites are distributed to testers based on their history, findings, and violation record. HackerOne is an organization that sends invites and these invites may require extensive background checks.

- Public - these programs are accessible to anyone and are open to all parties.

- Parent/Child - an organization has their own bounty hunting pool that works with a security team among a parent company and it's subsidiaries. 

The difference between BBPs and VRPs is that Vulnerability Disclosure Programs has a set of guidelines and does not offer monetary compensation.
