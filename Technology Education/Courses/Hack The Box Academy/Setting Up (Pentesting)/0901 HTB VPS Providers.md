# VPS Providers

A Virtual Private Server ( #VPS) is a Virtual Machine ( #VM) running on a physical server that creates an isolated environment with various operating systems ( #OS) and applications. This is an Infrastructure-as-a-service ( #IaaS) solution that works as if you have a dedicated server. This is also known as a Virtual Dedicated Server ( #VDS). 

These Virtual Servers were created to create a cost-saving alternative to renting servers or running your own server hardware. With VPS you can run multiple server instances on a single hardware setup at little to no added costs.

#Linode and #DigitalOcean are examples of rented servers you can pay for if you do not want to host your own VPS.
