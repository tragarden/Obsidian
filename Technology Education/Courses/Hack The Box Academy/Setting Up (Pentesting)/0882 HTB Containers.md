# Containers

A #Container is a group of processes that runs on a host and acts together as an application. These processes operate under a specific set of rules and conditions that allow them to work in conjunction with one another. It is important to note the lack of #OS and #kernel in these containers, making them distinctly different and lighter weight than a Virtual Machine ( #VM). Containers are easily implemented and incredibly scalable.

#Linux began using containers for applications so the kernel could isolate the applications so they would not have influence over each other. 

When various containers were running on the same system, Linux Container Daemons ( #LXD) were used. 

Linux Containers ( #LXC) were originally used to execute code in isolation.

### Docker

#Docker is a #FOSS #software that allows you to run applications in containers that run in isolation. This enables you to deploy applications in isolation to observe what happens during their runtime without threat to your system. Docker stores these virtualized applications in images. 

Docker engine is the interface between the hardware and application containers. Docker engine is designed for Linux, so if you want to run it on Windows you will need to user a virtual machine to accomplish this.
