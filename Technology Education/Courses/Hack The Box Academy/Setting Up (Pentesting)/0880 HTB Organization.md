# Organization Methods

Organization is quite important within the realm of #pentesting, not only for our own sanity and understanding, but also to create a professional presentation that our client will be able to interpret and understand.

### Operating Systems

In many cases you will interact with #heterogeneous networks where the devices on the #network use a variety of operating systems. An easy way to begin organizing the target network is by what #OS the devices are using. Segregating #Linux machines from #Windows machines is a great way to begin organizing the many components within the organization.

### Testing Fields

Every penetration tester will work differently and have different strengths within their skillset. A good secondary method of organization includes separating the different fields of testing into a hierarchical breakdown of the tests performed and the related data returned from the tests.

Separating into different fields of testing also improves our ability to detect errors and to perform comparisons between multiple fields.

### Bookmarks and Add-ons

Having a list of useful bookmarks and add-ons for your #browser is a vital part of organizing our resources. This set of tools is easily added to a browser, yet this becomes a time-consuming endeavor when we are doing it for each client. #Firefox browser offers a function that allows us to export our bookmarks and add-ons to other iterations of Firefox that we are initializing. This means you can install Firefox onto a new device and import all of your bookmarks, add-ons, and configurations. These can easily be intercepted by third parties so it is useful to create an extra Firefox profile to save your professional configuration, keeping it separate from your personal data.

### Password Managers

Password management is usually a hassle for most people, and many choose to disregard good security practices because it is time-consuming and frustrating to maintain so many personal and company passwords. This leads to people choosing easily compromised passwords, or reusing the same password many times. 

There are three main factors to consider when managing passwords:

#### Complexity

The complexity of passwords plays a major role in security vulnerabilities. Most people will prefer to use a password that has semblance of passive language that can be understood by a human being. Unfortunately, these are also the passwords that are most commonly used and brute-forced. It is much more secure to use non-language based passwords that incorporate special characters, multiple cases, and numbers - but these are much more difficult to remember.

#### Re-use

When a user has decided to use a complex password and committed to memorizing it, they will often want to use this password for many interfaces as they have invested time and energy memorizing this abstract string of characters. This creates a security issue as a single device may become compromised, effectively granting access to every device that shares the same password. One insecure device in the network can become compromised, which will in turn compromise all devices and even software within the network. 

#### Memory

Most people will be able to follow the above rules, but will likely fall short within this last phase: remembering all of those complex and unique passwords. It is highly unlikely that anyone will be able to memorize all of these, which leads to them writing them down locally or, even worse. saving them to a plaintext or Word file on their machine. If a remote user gains access to the desktop or an agent of evil walks up to their desk - all of these passwords will be conveniently revealed. They can then be saved to a dictionary list and used from brute force attacks.

#### Password Managers

Password Managers solve all problems listed above. They generate unique and difficult to crack passwords, detect security flaws such as reused or weak passwords, and save all of your passwords in a convenient add-on that can auto-fill forms and offer #2FA features.

A manager like #1password can be used to fulfill all password needs, and offers extra security features and group integrations allowing others to access the same set of keys and passwords. 1password also has #Firefox integration, meaning when we import our Firefox bookmarks and add-ons, 1password will be included. We simply enter our master password in conjunction with #2FA credentials to access our password set.

### Updating and Automating

Ensuring that all devices, operating systems, apps, and interfaces are updated to the most current iteration is an important consideration. When something isn't current, there are known vulnerabilities and exploits that can be performed against them, creating security flaws and points of entry. We need to make sure that everything is up to date before we begin testing - this can be a long and arduous process, especially when we are doing on every network we encounter.

1password is able to save scripts that we can use to automate our upgrades. These scripts might be #BASH, #PowerShell, or #Python, and can be applied en masse to any network we connect to.

#### Notes

There is a lot of information worth recording when performing penetration tests, and these can typically be grouped into the following categories.

1. New Information - anything uncovered during our initial observations and tests.
2. Testing ideas and processes
3. Scan results
4. Logs
5. Screenshots

There are applications we can use to help improve our note taking and thinking process. HTB suggests checking out the following apps:

#Notion.so is a #markdown editor that helps you design a style of note pages that is personalized to your preferences.

#Xmind allows you to make graphic flow charts to help map out your thinking and hierarchical processes.

#Obsidian uses a folder system of basic text files to create a personal knowledge database for all of your notes, organized in a hierarchical and graphical way. You can internally and externally link, tag within notes, and depict these links and tags in a graphical relationship across all your notes.

#### Results

We will have a lot of data returned from the tests we perform and this amount of information can be overwhelming. Useful apps for managing our process, order, and results can be mapped out and recorded in app likes #GhostWriter and #Pwndoc.

#### Logs

Logging the data from our actions on someone else's network are important for monitoring and recording action on the network so we can observe and determine what is happening. In addition to this however, is the consideration of legal protections in the event that we can prove that we are not responsible for damages that happened on their network. If an attack occurred while we are penetration testing, you would be able to prove that it was an outside party. 

#Date is used to timestamp each command that is submitted to the #CLI while we are working.

#Script can be used to record every command to a text file by replacing the #PS1 variable in .bashrc. (see HTB for this example)

#### Screenshot

#Flameshot is a common tool for taking screenshots where you can quickly crop and modify them for sending your test results to the intended recipient. 

#Peek is another app that can be used to make GIFs of our actions and test results.
