# Introduction to Penetration Testing

Penetration Testing ( #pentesting) is a complex matter and relies on a proper set up to ensure that both the tester and the network are prepared for the full range of tests we can perform.

Making sure that any #OS or #VM is set up correctly and established in the #network is important.

Penetration tests can be performed on-loaction or remotely. If we are performinmg an in-house test, a tester would drive to the location of the network with a set of tools and devices that would allow them to assess all aspects of the network both physically and logically.

In the case that we are performing a remote test a device will be delivered to the client requesting penetration testing. This device will be configured with the proper #VPN, #OS, and #VM. Alternatively they can request a VM clone from us which they will image onto one of their drives.

While penetration testing, we will connect to the internal or local host (127.0.0.1) to perform our tests. If the local host is connected to the internet, we need to isolate it within a Virtua Private Server ( #VPS) to protect the network from possible damage from our testing.

It is likely you will need to have access to both #Linux and #Windows operating systems, especially if the network you are penetrating uses Active Directory. Networks that depend on both Linux and Windows are known as #heterogeneous networks.
