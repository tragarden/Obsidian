# Virtualization

#Virtualization is the abstracting of components of physical computing such as #hardware, #software, #storage, and #network related items. This is using an existing physical hardware component to generate a logical iteration of a secondary component. These systems allow us to use technologies together that would usually be incompatible.

Hardware virtualization relies on a #hypervisor software to virtually render logical hardware components. This serves as if we have another physical computer running - this is what is known as a Virtual Machine ( #VM).

Virtual Machines ( #VM) allow a single computer to allocate it's hardware resources to the generation of multiple operating systems in isolation. 

VMs are desirable for a variety of reasons:

- These machines run in isolation, so any damage that occurs can simply be erased with no consequence.
- They are able to be cloned and applied to many machines through automation.
- Expanding the use of existing hardware that may not be used to its full potential.
