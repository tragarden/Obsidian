# Algebraic Notations

- Subscript Notation - x_t where x is a variable and t is the index.

- Norm - (II...II) - used to measure the length or size of a vector. A common example is the Euclidian norm. An example using norm and subscript notation is below:

>||v|| = sqrt{v_1^2 + v_2^2 + ... + v_n^2}

- Manhattan Distance (L1 Norm)

>||v||\_1 = |v\_1| + \|v\_2| + ... + \|v\_n|

- Maximum Absolute Value (L∞ Norm)

>\||v||\_∞ = max(|v\_1| + \|v\_2| + ... + \|v\_n|)

- Logarithms
	- Base 2 is used in information theory to measure entropy.
	- Natural Logarithms use Euler's Number e to solve problems in calculus, differential equations, and probability.

- Exponential Functions
	- raised to the power of e is used for modeling growth and decay, probability distributions, and development of physical models.
	- 2 raised to the power of x is used within binary systems.

- Matrix and Vector Operations
	- used within linear algebra to transform vectors, solve systems of linear equations, and within neural networks.
	- Transpose means exchanging the rows and columns within a matrix.
	- The inverse of matrix A results in the identity matrix when it is multiplied with matrix A.
	- The determinant of a square matrix is a scalar value that can be computed and used within matrix operations. This determines whether a matrix is invertible or a non-zero determinant while calculating volume, area, or geometric transformations.
	- Trace is the sum of elements on the main diagonal of a square matrix.

- Cardinality - the number of elements in a set S depicted as |S| and is used to determine counting elements and probability.

- Union - all elements included within two sets.
- Intersection - all elements that are shared between two sets.
- Complement - all elements that are not within the selected set.

#### Eigenvalue λ

Eigenvalue is represented by lambda and are used to understand the behaviors of linear transformations, principal component analysis (PCA), and optimization.

An Eigenvector is a non-zero vector that results in a scalar multiple of itself when multiplied by a matrix. The scalar value is the eigenvector.

##### Other

A Reciprocal in the context of AI simply means one divided by an expression to invert the value.

A Conditional Probability Distribution is notated as P(x | y) and are used within Bayesian Inference, decision making during uncertainty, and probabilistic modeling.

An Expectation Operator is notated as E\[...] and represents a random variable's expected value of the probability distribution.

Variance is a measure of the range between a given variable and the mean.

Standard Deviation is the square root of the variance to measure the dispersion of a variable.

Covariance measure the variance between two variables.

Correlation is the normalized covariance measure between -1 and 1. This indicates the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two random variables.
