# Logistic Regression

A Logistic Regression is another facet of supervised learning that is used to classify new data and is ironically not used for modeling regression. It predicts categorical target variables that have two possible outcomes - these are represented as binary values in binary classification.

A Classification in the context of machine learning is a type of supervised learning that assigns data points to specific categories or classes. Note that these differ from linear regressions in that they create a discrete label instead of predicting continuous values.

These regressions are used for things like:

- Identifying fraudulent transactions.
- Classifying images.
- Diagnosing diseases based on symptoms.

Logistic Regression renders it's output as a probability score with a range of 0 to 1 where 1 is a strong positive indicator that the data point belongs to a known class.

#### Sigmoid Function

A Sigmoid Function is often employed as a probability function that maps any input value within the range of 0 to 1. This is a non-linear function that can observe and display complex relationships between features and outcome probability.
