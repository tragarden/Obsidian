# Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised Learning is used to observe and explore unlabeled data to discover hidden patterns, structures, and relationships. This is done without the guidance of predefined labels or 'correct answers.' It is distinct from supervised learning where the goal is to predict outcomes.

You can think of unsupervised learning as looking at a new and unfamiliar map and making conclusions about items on the map.

These are particularly powerful methods when data is unavailable, rare, or expensive. It yields insights into the structure and organization of the data without observing outcomes.

There are three main categories for unsupervised learning:

- Clustering - when similar data points are grouped together by attributes or characteristics.
- Dimensionality Reduction - reducing the number of variables or features while preserving the essential information, akin to summarizing a text or compressing an image file.
- Anomaly Detection - identifying outlying data points and deviations from the observed norm. 

### Core Concepts

#### Unlabeled Data

Unsupervised Learning relies heavily on unlabeled data that is lacking in predicted outcomes. The model relies on characteristics of data instead of outcomes. 

#### Similarity Measures

Unsupervised Learning rely heavily on assessing and quantifying the level of similarity or dissimilarity between data points. 

Common methods for measuring similarity include:

- Euclidean Distance - the straight-line distance between two points.
- Cosine Similarity - the angle between two vectors with higher values representing increased similarity.
- Manhattan Distance - a calculation for distance where absolute difference between coordinates are summed.

#### Clustering Tendency

Clustering Tendency is the data's inherent nature to form clusters, before clustering algorithms are applied to the data. If the data is distributed in a uniform way, clustering algorithms may not benefit the results.

#### Cluster Validity
