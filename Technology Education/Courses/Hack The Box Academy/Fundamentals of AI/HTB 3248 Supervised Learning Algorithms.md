# Supervised Learning

Machine Learning is dependent on Supervised Learning to enable it's systems to learn from established and categorized data to make accurate predictions. Data points are associated with known outcomes, almost as if you were taking a multiple choice test with the answers pre-selected.

The algorithm develops a mapping function to predict identifiers for new and unknown data by identifying patterns and relationships between existing labels. This allows the model to use it's known data to generate new general knowledge.

The algorithm looks at the characteristics of a given item in order to learn how to distinguish that item from others. This allows the model to begin making predictions for unknown items in the future.
