# Generative AI

Generative Artificial Intelligence is a field within Machine Learning that creates new content or data that emulates human-generated output. The intention is to produce original content in creative fields like text, music, image, and code generation.

The algorithms used by generative ai is most commonly based on neural networks used to learn patterns and structures. Statistical properties are applied to these algorithms to generate other new samples that share characteristics.

The general process has three steps:

- Training - examples of text, images, or sounds are given to the agent and the model learns statistical relationships between the input content.
- Generation - creation of new content from sampling the learned distribution of input content. A random seed is generated before being iteratively refined based on agent policies aimed towards accurate content creation.
- Evaluation - generated content is assessed for quality, originality, and resemblence to relevant human created content. This evaluation can be subjective or rely on human judgement - or it can be objective and use indicated metrics for specific properties.

####  Concepts

There are various models and concepts that are currently being used within the generative AI space.

##### Latent Space 

Latent Space is a hidden representation of data that captures it's essential features and relationships in a compressed form. Variational Autoencoders (VAE) interpret this co
