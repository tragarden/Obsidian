# Recurrent Neural Networks

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are designed to handle sequential data where order of the data points matters. They maintain a memory of past inputs in order to capture temporal dependencies and patterns within these sequences. These networks are strongly suited to natural language processing, speech recognition, and time series analysis.

The recurrent connections in these networks create loops within the network that allow the information to persist and pass on to a next step. This works the same way as auto-predicted text on your phone - a new word is always predicted but the more of a sentence you write, the more specific the next prediction would be.
