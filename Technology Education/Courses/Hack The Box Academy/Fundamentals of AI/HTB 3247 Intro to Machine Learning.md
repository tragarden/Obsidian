# Artificial Intelligence

### Machine Learning

Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are terms that are incorrectly used in an interchangeable fashion. These are two distinctly different concepts.

Artificial Intelligence is a broad field focused on developing intelligent systems that are capable of performing tasks that typically rely on human reasoning and intelligence. This includes understanding natural languages, recognizing objects, making decisions, solving problems, and learning from experience.

AI is able to exhibit cognitive abilities like reasoning, perception, and problem solving tasks like:

- Natural Language processing (NLP) - enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.
- Computer Vision - allows computers to see and interpret images and visuals.
- Robotics - developing computer aided machines that can autonomously perform tasks alone or with the aid of a human.
- Expert Systems - mimic the decision making abilities of humans.

It should be understood that AI is meant to be used as a tool for assisting human work, not a substitute for human workers. The intention is top enhance, support, and predict human behavior and sometimes perform mechanical tasks.

Industries that will directly benefit from the implementation of AI include:

- Healthcare - useful for accurate diagnoses and discovery of drug analogues.
- Finance - optimizes investments and detects patterns related to fraud.
- Cybersecurity - identifies threat vectors and mitigates them.

Machine Learning is a category of artificial intelligence with a focus on enabling systems to learn from acquired data and modify performance and decision making based on this information. These feature algorithms that use analysis and statistical techniques to identify patterns that are used to make predictions or decisions.

There are three types of Machine Learning:

- Supervised Learning - each data point is associated with a known value and the algorithm is modified based on these associations. 
	- Image Classification
	- Spam Detection
	- Fraud Prevention

- Unsupervised Learning - when the algorithm is developed according to unlabeled data and no associations with produced values or outcomes.
	- Customer Segmentation
	- Anomaly Detection
	- Dimensionality Reduction

- Reinforcement Learning - algorithm development through trial and error via interactions within an environment. Feedback is used in the form of rewards and penalties accordingly.
	- Game Playing
	- Robotics
	- Autonomous Driving

#### Deep Learning

Deep Learning (DL) is a category of Machine Learning that utilizes neural networks to analyze complex data sets. They evaluate and analyze complex patterns and are particularly adept at working with unstructured data or data with many dimensions.

Key identifying features of deep learning include:

- Hierarchical Feature Learning - ability to learn hierarchical data that is structured in layers. As an example, low level layers might detect textures during image analysis while higher layers analyze shapes and objects in the images.

- End-to-end Learning - able to plot raw input data to associated outputs without manual intervention from human sources.

- Scalability - able to work within large data sets.

The types of neural networks used for deep learning include:

- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) - use convolutional layers to detect local patterns and spatial hierarchies for images and video.

- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) - processes sequential data using loops that allow information to persist.

- Transformers - the most recent advent of machine learning that are most adept at interpreting and processing natural languages. This is accomplished by using self-attention mechanisms.
