# Common Vulnerability Scoring System

The Common Vulnerability Scoring System ( #CVSS) is a system that evaluates the severity of a vulnerability and calculates a score used as a general reference. This is helpful in prioritizing mitigation methods and determining the most threatened parts of the network. This is often used in conjunction with other scoring methods like #Microsoft #DREAD.

CVSS and DREAD both use five factors to calculate the risk associated with a given vulnerability:

- Potential Damage
- Reproduction likelihood
- Exploitation likelihood
- How many users are affected
- How discoverable is this vulnerability?

### Metric Groups

Each of the previously mentioned factors have their own associated scoring methods. This means that a category such as 'Exploitation' will have it's own factors for determining the severity of the exploitation in question. The two relevant metrics in this case are Exploitability and Impact.

#### Exploitability

When considering the severity of exploitability, we have four metrics we can examine to determine the severity of any exploit. The metrics include:

- Attack Vector - what is it and how much damage can it do?
- Attack Complexity - is the attack easily implemented or difficult to achieve?
- Privileges Required - does this attack require escalated privileges?
- User Interaction - does a user within the network need to play a role in this attack?

#### Impact

The metrics for the Impact factor include the three principals of the #CIA triad: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. We must maintain these three core values in order to have a secure and reliably network. 

###### Confidentiality

Confidentiality is important because many credentials and means for unauthorized access are contained within the files and components of our networks. If confidentiality is breached, an attacker gains access to this sensitive information, allowing them to escalate privileges or access unauthorized areas or resources.

###### Integrity

Integrity refers to control over file modification and ensuring that resources remain unchanged or documenting authorized changes. If an attacker gains entry to our systems and our integrity is low, they will be able to access and modify files within our databases and devices.

###### Availability

Availability means having system data accessible to any authorized user at any time. In terms of an attack, a ransomware attack would render the network totally unavailable to its owners. This would be a huge security threat, as all our data would be compromised, unavailable to us, and in the hands of an unauthorized agent.

### Temporal Metric Group

The Temporal Metric Group describes how available exploits or remediation methods are for a given vulnerability. This means that they assess the potential exploits, code, and methods for attacking at the current time. These scores should go down with time as the remedies and patches applied lower the likelihood of the exploit being successful.

#### Exploit Code Maturity

Exploit Code Maturity details the possibility that a vulnerability can be exploited. The metrics associated with this fall into four categories: 

- Not Defined indicates that there is no reason to consider this metric for the given vulnerability.
- 'High' represents exploitative code that is also easily identified with automation.
- Functional means that exploitative code is readily available to the public.
- Proof-of-Concept means that while the exploitative code is available, the attacker would need to commit changes to the network to execute this attack.

#### Remediation Level

Remediation level defines the priority level of an vulnerability. This indicates how well we will be able to address a particular vulnerability if it is present.

- Not Defined indicates that there is no reason to consider this metric for the given vulnerability.
- Unavailable implies that there are no patches currently available to address this vulnerability.
- Workaround means that an unofficial solution is available but no official patch is available.
- Temporary Fix indicates that the official vendor provided temporary solutions without patching.
- Official Fix means an official patch is available to the public from the vendor.

#### Report Confidence

Report Confidence refers to how strongly the documentation for a vulnerability identifies the problem, confirming how much we know about a given problem.

- Not Defined indicates that there is no reason to consider this metric for the given vulnerability.
- Confirmed means that various sources have identified the vulnerability with thorough documentation.
- Reasonable means there are published documents about this vulnerability.
- Unknown means that there is little reliable information about this vulnerability.

### Environmental Metric Group

This describes the threat level of a vulnerability within a given environment, relying on the key tenets of the CIA triad to define these cases.

#### Modified Base Metrics

These metrics evaluate vulnerabilities in respect to the CIA triad - how does the vulnerability in question impact the concepts of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability? 

- Not Defined indicates that there is no reason to consider this metric for the given vulnerability.
- 'High' indicates that one of the CIA triad values are severely affected and will consequently have severe affects on the organization and their clients.
- Medium means significant affect to the organization.
- Low means minimal affect to the organization.

### Calculating

There are multiple resources for calculating these scores on your own and determining the threat level.
