# Nessus Scanning Issues

Problems with #Nessus scans usually entail harming target systems or producing inaccurate results like false positives, or no results at all. Discuss with your client or internal providers whether there should be any exclusions when you perform your scans. 

### Mitigation

Rate-limiting is a commonly used method for assessing a sensitive network. Under Performance Options, we can change the "Max Concurrent Checks per Host" setting to limit the rate of activity when performing scans, making the scan more evasive and less 'loud'.

Some Firewalls have #ICMP detection, meaning they will resist any ping requests by saying that all ports are closed. We can remedy this by toggling the "Ping Remote Host" option.

Legacy technology and printers can be very sensitive to Nessus scans and a common option for many testers is to add these printers and older devices to the exclusion list.

Denial of Service ( #DOS) attacks should be avoided and these are disabled whenever we perform 'safe checks'. DOS attacks can overwhelm the network daemon and crash the network as we are scanning it.

### Network Impact 

We can use the tool #vnstat to evaluate how much impact our scans are having on a target. 

To install vnstat, use the following command:

>sudo apt install vnstat

We will use vnstat to evaluate an ethernet connection with the following command:

>sudo vnstat -l -i eth0
