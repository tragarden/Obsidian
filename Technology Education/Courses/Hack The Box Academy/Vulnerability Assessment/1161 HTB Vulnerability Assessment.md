# Vulnerability Assessment

Vulnerability Assessments are typically automated scans using applications and tools that will identify vulnerabilities and suggest or enact remediation methods. On rare occasions there will be manual discovery methods, but this is uncommon in vulnerability assessment. This stage is intended to identify the vulnerabilities and supply a report to the staff.

### Methodology

HTB Academy has provided a general set of steps for making vulnerability assessments:

1. Risk Analysis - identifying every asset within the #network, including all hardware, and evaluating the risk associated with each asset.
2. Scanning Policies - management should assign an owner for the policies in place.
3. Scan Types - define the types of scans needed on the network.
4. Configuring Scans - define parameters related to the scan types needed, such as #IP ranges, #port ranges, protocols involved, list of targets, time and date, as well as aggression levels of the scans.
5. Performing Scans - begin scanning targets and enumerating their ports and services.
6. Evaluate Risk - determine the risk involved with the scans you are implementing, especially regarding how they will affect the availability of targets.
7. Interpret Results - determine if there are publicly known exploits in the targets.
8. Remediation and Mitigation - Mitigate any detected vulnerability if possible by communicating with your team.

#### Vulnerability

We use the term vulnerability countless times in cyber security. A Vulnerability is a known flaw or bug in the network environment components like software or infrastructure. #MITRE documents these in the Common Vulnerability Exposure ( #CVE) database with an associated Common Vulnerability Scoring System Score ( #CVSS) describing the threat level of the vulnerability. These scores are a standard method for calculating the total threat level against an entire network. CVE scores represent multiple metrics of threat in a scale of 1-10 so we can easily assess what we're dealing with and prioritize mitigation techniques accordingly.

#### Threat

A Threat can be described as a process that increases the potential intensity of a vulnerability. If a vulnerability is easily exploited, the threat level increases. 

#### Exploit

An Exploit is the code or resource used to access and utilize a known vulnerability. There are sites that host these exploits such as #ExploitDB, although somewhat surprisingly we can find them on #GitHub as well.

#### Risk

Risk is the probability that an asset vulnerability is susceptible to exploitation.

#### Differences 

The three factors of Threat, Risk, and Vulnerabilities are compared and assessed together in order to determine an overall level of risk involved with a given vulnerability. To summarize these terms we could say the following is true:

- Risk is the chance of something bad happening.
- Threat means something bad is currently happening.
- Vulnerabilities refer to the weak points that enable the theat. 

We can apply these three concepts to a matrix that determines the probability that an exploit will occur and the severity of the occurrence. We compare the level of impact vs the likelihood the event will happen and assign it a threat level between 1-5.

The matrix looks like this:

|  | Low | Medium | High |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| High | 3 | 4 | 5 |
| Medium | 2 | 3 | 4 |
| Low | 1 | 2 | 3 |


### Asset Management

#### Inventory

When an organization wants to protect their assets, the first step is identifying those assets and documenting them so we know how many assets need protection. This will include ALL hardware, software, technology, and data assets for the entire organization.

##### Cloud

In addition to the locally kept assets, it is vital to audit all of our assets kept by #cloud providers like #Amazon Web Services ( #AWS), #Microsoft #Azure, and #Google Cloud Platform ( #GCP) 

##### SaaS

Most of the time people consider Software as a Service ( #SaaS) to be within the realm of cloud, but many of these assets are not within the scope of AWS, Azure, or GCP. In the case of SaaS we will audit our data stored on applications such as Google Drive, Dropbox, Teams, iCloud, Office 365, and Google Docs.

#### Transference 

Whenever we are migrating data between different storage methods, we need to take these changes into account during our audits. All changes should be well documented and any inventory data should be adjusted accordingly.
