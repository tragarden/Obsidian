# Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

Open Vulnerability Assessment Language ( #OVAL) is an international security standard supported by the Cybersecurity and Commissions department of the US Department of Homeland Security ( #DHS), as well as the National Institute of Standardization and Technology ( #NIST). This language is used to automate vulnerability management and increase understanding for encoding and repositories for the security community. 

### Composition

The OVAL language has three key components and four possible states:

#### Components:

- Identifying system configurations
- Evaluating the state of the system
- Publishing a report 

#### States

- Vulnerable
- Non-Compliant
- Installed Asset
- Patched

### Definitions

There are over 7,000 OVAL definitions which are presented in an #XML format allowing them to be easily implemented for the purposes of discovering vulnerabilities. This allows users to identify vulnerabilities in software and system misconfigurations without exploiting them.

There are four classes of OVAL definitions:

- Vulnerability Definitions detect system issues.
- Compliance Definitions ensure system configurations match policies.
- Inventory Definitions detect the presence of software.
- Patch Definitions ensure patches are current and applied.

These definitions are used in the OVAL ID Format which is a unique identifier for each definition.

The syntax for OVAL ID Format is as follows:

>oval:Organization Domain Name:ID Type:ID Value

An example of a definition in OVAL ID Format:

>oval:org.mitre.oval:obj:1116

### CVE

Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ( #CVE) is a library of vulnerabilities from the CVE Numbering Authority ( #CNA) that is sponsored by the US Department of Homeland Security ( #DHS). The CVE is a method of standardizing descriptions and references to a vulnerability so that security professionals can determine how severe that vulnerability is. 

Conditions for a vulnerability obtaining a CVE ID assignment from the CNA include:

- The vulnerability must be independently fixable.
- The vulnerability must affect only one codebase.
- The vulnerability must be acknowledged and documented by the affected vendor.

In the case that a vulnerability is *NOT* independently fixable, multiple CVEs will be created. 

### ID Acquisition Stages

#### 1. Is CVE Required and Relevant?

Determine if the problem is truly a vulnerability. The qualifying traits of a vulnerability mean there is available exploitative code that affects the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability of a network. 

#### 2. Contact the Affected Vendor

The vulnerability researcher needs to reach out to the affected vendor.

#### 3. Vendor CNA or Third Party CNA?

If the company is involved with CNA, you can assign a CVE through them. If not, you will need to go through a third party that is involved with CNA.

#### 4. Requesting a CVE ID

Fill out the CVE form if the above methods were unsuccessful.

#### 5. Confirmation 

After submitting the form - a confirmation email will be sent.

#### 6. Receiving a CVE ID

Once approved, the private CVE ID will be disclosed to the researcher. 

#### 7. Public Disclosure

Once all parties are aware of the vulnerability and the private CVE ID, it can be made public. 

#### 8. Announcement of the CVE

The CVE team contacts researchers to make sure each CVE represents only one vulnerability.

#### 9. Inform the CVE Team

The CVE team requests more information from the researchers before committing the information to the US National Vulnerability Database ( #NVD).
