# Assessment Standards

When performing penetration tests or vulnerability assessments, it is important to adhere to a set of regulatory standards enacted by government and regulatory agencies. These standards are implemented to regulate the security standards for an organization and prevent attacks.

### Compliance Standards

The standards an organization is adhering to are monitored and enforced by third party organizations that audit the company to make sure they are complying. Regulatory acts like #PCI, #HIPAA, #FISMA, and #CISA are all regulations that must be followed by organizations, otherwise they may face huge penalties and repercussions for violating these laws. These laws are in place to protect not only the organization but the clients they serve as well.

#### Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard 

Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard( #PCI-DSS ) is the regulatory document for protecting credit card data. This is not implemented by governments, but is still strongly enforced and required by any business that acquires payment card data from clients. 

This act requires companies to scan all related assets both internally and externally. There is a Cardholder Data Environment ( #CDE) standard that ensures that all transactions are executed and recorded within an environment that is kept independent of the rest of the organizations' network. 

The goals of the PCI-DSS include:

1. Create and maintain secure networks.
2. Protect data for all cardholders.
3. Maintain Vulnerability Management processes.
4. Use strong Access Control features.
5. Monitor and test all networks regularly.
6. Maintain information security policies.

#### HIPAA

Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ( #HIPAA) maintains confidentiality of a clients' medical data. Risk assessment and identification of vulnerabilities is required under this act.

#### Federal Information Security Management Act

 Federal Information Security Management Act ( #FISMA) enforces protections for government affiliated organizations and requires documentation and a vulnerability management property to ensure the three concepts of the #CIA triad are maintained: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

#### ISO 27001

International Organization for Standardization ( #ISO) creates many technical standards and created the ISO 27001 standard to enforce internal and external scans on a quarterly basis. This means that to be within compliance the organization must complete penetration tests and vulnerability assessments quarterly.

### Penetration Test Standards

When performing a penetration test, there are standardized rules and guidelines that help us determine the scope of the test. A contractual agreement between an organization and the pentesting group must be signed by whoever owns the network in question. These guidelines make sure the tests are performed in a way that minimizes possible damage and restores the network to its original level of operation. 

#### PTES

Penetration Testing Execution Standard 9 ( #PTES) is an outline for the different stages of a penetration test. The stages are as follows:

- Pre-Engagement Interactions
- Information Gathering
- Threat Modeling
- Vulnerability Analysis
- Exploitation
- Post-Exploitation
- Reporting

#### OSSTMM

The Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual ( #OSSTMM) is a set of standards for pentesters that is divided into 5 categories, ensuring testers are doing a thorough job.

1. Social Engineering and Human Security
2. Physical Security
3. Wireless Security
4. Telecommunications 
5. Data Networks

#### NIST

The National Institute of Standards and Technology ( #NIST) created a Penetration Testing Framework with four Distinct categories. NIST is also known for their Cybersecurity Framework.

- Planning
- Discovery
- Attack
- Reporting

#### OWASP

The Open Web Application Security Project ( #OWASP) has their own testing standards and risk classification model. Some of the standards worth reading about are:

 - Web Security Testing Guide ( #WSTG)
 - Mobile Security Testing Guide ( #MSTG)
 - Firmware Security Testing Methodology
