# Nessus Scan Output

#Nessus can provide it's output as raw data or formatted for integration with other tools. 

### Reports

Nessus can generate output reports in the .pdf, .html. and .csv formats. These reports list #enumeration results and the associated #CVSS and #plugin numbers. There are options to limit what is included in the scan and related integrations for other tools. This output information is suitable for our purposes only and should never be submitted to a client as a Vulnerability Assessment report.

### Exporting Scan Results

Nessus provides two formats for it's export scan results: Nessus (scan.nessus) or Nessus DB (scan.db). The .nessus file is an #XML file with the scan settings and output data. The .db file contains this .nessus file in addition to a plugin Audit Trail and KB information. 

The following command uses the Nessus REST #API and nessus-report-downloader to download the results in all formats:
