# Security Assessments

Security Assessments are a necessary part of every organization's regular maintenance for networks, computers, and applications. Having a staff and automated system for assessing these components is important for securing the organization systems and any personal data that is stored within them.

### Vulnerability Assessment

Vulnerability Assessments apply a security standard that adheres to certain compliance rules to enforce the standard. These may be specific to a network, industry, technology, or organization. They may be performed by the organization staff or a third party.

### Penetration Test

A Penetration Test ( #Pentest) is when we simulate an attack on a network or system to determine if there are means for acquiring sensitive data or unauthorized access.

#### Application

Application pentesters attack web applications, APIs, and Mobile Applications.

#### Infrastructure

Infrastructure or Network pentesters attack all aspects of a network, from the technology that powers communications to the servers, clients, and hosts that access the network. They have thorough understanding of operating systems, active directory, network technology, and coding languages.

#### Physical

Physical pentesters examine the physical aspects of an organization, such as #RFID badges, entryways, contractor access, doors, windows, and even ducts that an attacker may climb through. 

#### Social Engineering

Social Engineering pentesters examine the human aspects of an organization, implementing phishing attacks and will attempt to gain access to a building through charisma and tricking staff in the building in order to gain access.

### Security Maturity

Security Maturity describes how prepared an organization is when it comes to defending and maintaining the different facets of the network and facilities. The scope of this includes the education levels of the staff, current security policies, rate of enforcement, hardening of the related network technology, compliance to regulations, incident response plans, incident response team, and overall security culture for the organization. Staff should be aware of security concepts and have concern for if they are being implemented or not. There should be a Chief Information Security Officer ( #CISO) and a Chief Technical Officer ( #CIO).

The organization in question should have a developed level of security maturity before a pentest is performed. If we perform pentests at an immature stage, we may find that there are so many vulnerabilities that the test is not even needed - we should have spent time hardening our network first. 

### What's the Difference?

The difference between a vulnerability assessment and a penetration test is the attacking aspect. While they seem similar, they are distinctly different and complement each other. There will be no exploitations of a vulnerability during an assessment, unlike penetration tests. The Assessment uses standards like #GDPR and #OWASP to evaluate a network via checklists. These assessments seek out medium to critical level vulnerabilities, enumerate and document them, but never exploit these findings.

Vulnerability Assessment is more cost effective than a Penetration test and requires less knowledge to perform. Penetration tests cost a lot of time, money and knowledge.

### Audits

Security Audits are required by third-parties like government agencies or industry regulations. These are not a choice and are intended to enforce regulatory policies and ensure that an organization is compliant with laws and industry standards.

### Bug Bounty

Bug Bounties are when organizations invite the public to seek out vulnerabilities. The organization will offer rewards for any bugs you find, and these rewards may be hundreds of thousands of dollars. These programs are usually implemented by large companies with a high level of security maturity.

### Red Team

Red Teams are used to offensively test an organizations systems to ensure there are no means of unauthorized access. This team includes penetration testers that are well equipped and knowledgeable about the systems involved and means of attack. These teams will continuously learn about new vulnerabilities through documented exploits and results from Advanced Persistent Threat Groups ( #APT).

### Purple Team

Blue Teams are the defensive counterpart to Red Teams and are often staff that work in the Security Operations Center ( #SOC) and the Computer Security Incident Response Teams (  #CSIRT). Purple team refers to when these teams work together, where red team is attacking the systems and blue team is observing the attacks and planning means of remediation.
