# Vulnerability Scanning

### Testing Types

A static test uses automation to detect vulnerabilities for any documented CVE. This is not the most accurate way of detection, as a system may not appear to be vulnerable under the eyes of the scanner, yet the vulnerability is still present. 

A dynamic test submits basic and weak payloads like brute-forcing weak credentials and benign injection methods. 

These scans should be performed with both Authenticated and Unauthenticated access. A combination of static, dynamic, authenticated, and unauthenticated tests should be used to increase the likelihood that the most vulnerabilities are detected.

#### Scanners

Common scanners used in vulnerability scanners include #Nessus, #Nexpose, and #Qualys. There is also #OpenVAS, which is #FOSS.

### Nessus

#Nessus is a paid scanning technology, but free community versions are available and an excellent way to get started using scanners. The limiting factor to the free version is that it can only be used to scan a maximum of 16 hosts.

### OpenVAS

#OpenVAS is a Free and Open-source ( #FOSS) scanner from Greenbone Networks that can perform both authenticated and unauthenticated scans.
