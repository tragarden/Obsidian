# Reporting Vulnerability Scans

After completing a Vulnerability Scan, you will need to provide a report that summarizes what we did and what we discovered during out scans.

A report will be comprised of the following parts:

- Executive Summary
- Assessment Overview
- Scope
- Vulnerabilities
- Recommendations

#### Executive Summary

The Executive Summary provides a high-level summary intended to be presented to an executive that may not have deep technical knowledge. This will tell them what remediation methods to prioritize and details of the scans we performed.

#### Overview Assessment

The Overview Assessment provides the methods, tools, and general process used to perform our scans.

#### Scope 

The Scope should entail anything that was authorized by the client including the list of targets and the duration of testing.

#### Vulnerabilities and Recommendations

To close our report we will list the detected vulnerabilities and how we recommend addressing them. A basic outline for the topics to include in this part of the report is provided by HTB Academy:

- Name of the Vulnerability
- Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ( #CVE) details
- Common Vulnerability Scoring System ( #CVSS) details
- Description of the Vulnerability
- References
- Remediation methods
- Proof of Concept
- List of Affected Systems
