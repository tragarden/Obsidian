# Nessus Advanced Settings

### Scan Policies

Scan Policies are customized scans created by the user, which can be saved as a Scan Template for repeated use. These policies allow us to tweak scanning procedures for different purposes, such as more evasive scanning, web-focused scans, or scans using various sets of credentials.

#### Creating Scan Policies

Click on New Policy to reveal a list of default scans for #Nessus. Choose Advanced Scan to create a personalized scan policy. After choosing, enter a name and description of the scan you are creating. 

Next we can submit any credentials and compliance standards to be used in the scans. Save the policy, which should now be available under the new tab "User Defined" under the "Scan Templates" category.

#### Plugins

Plugins for Nessus allow us to perform different scans and each plugin is written in the Nessus Attack Scripting Language ( #NASL). The information within the plugin will include the name and description of the vulnerability, level of affect, as well as remediation and detection methods.

Tenable has published 150k plugins that all have a severity rating such as: Critical, High, Medium, Low, and Informational. All published plugins are available on the Tenable site.

Below we will use the sslscan plugin with the following command:

>sslscan website.com

#### Plugin Rules

In the Plugin Rules sections we can define items that will be excluded during our scans. We can exclude hosts and vulnerabilities that we do not want to evaluate. To exclude a host, you must provide the Plugin ID and the hostname.

#### Credential-Based Scans

Nessus is designed to work with many authentication methods, such as Kerberos, LM/NTLM, SSH, public key, various database authentication methods, or Windows based authentication. 

If you want to use these features in the HTB VMs, use the following credentials:

- #Windows: u: htb-student_adm p: HTB_\@cademy_student!
- #Linux: u: administrator p: Academy_VA_adm1!
