# Nessus Scan

We can setup our first #Nessus scan by selecting New Scan and choosing the type of scan we intend to perform. The available categories include: Discovery, Vulnerabilities, and Compliance.

### New Scan

After choosing the option for New Scan, choose 'Basic Network Scan' under the Discovery category. In the following window, enter a name for the scan and enter the #IP address of the scan target.

For this module, the target for #Windows is 172.16.16.100 and the target for #Linux is 172.16.16.160.

### Discovery

#### Host Discovery

Within the Discovery section of Nessus, under the sub-category 'Host Discovery', there will be a checklist for Fragile Devices. Make sure the box 'Scan Network Printers' is left **UNCHECKED** otherwise when Nessus scans the printer, it will begin printing random pages of text.

#### Port Scanning

Under the Port Scanning menu you may need to disable "Probe all ports  to find services" when you are interacting with weak hardware, as this scan could crash the device. In most cases though it will not cause issues.

#### Assessment

Under the Assessment category, we can choose to enable web application scanning. Following this, Nessus can also attempt to gain access to any discovered applications. A wordlist of default credentials can be used to perform a brute-force attack via this interface.

#### User Enumeration

We can toggle the #RID Brute-Forcing option to enumerate the users on the network. If you choose to do this, you will need to assign the beginning and ending User IDs ( #UID) for all domain and local user accounts.

#### Advanced

In the Advanced settings we can toggle "Enable safe checks", which is an option that ensures Nessus will not perform any tests that may adversely affect the networked devices. We can also throttle the scanning rate if Nessus detects an influx of network traffic that leads to congestion. We can force Nessus to scan through the IP list in a random order or cease any scans on unresponsive hosts.
