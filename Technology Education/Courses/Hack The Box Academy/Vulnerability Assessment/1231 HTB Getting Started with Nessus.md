# Getting Started with Nessus

This is a guide for installing and using #Nessus on your Virtual Machine ( #VM). 

### Download

Search for the download page for Nessus and install the appropriate Nessus binary files for your operating system ( #OS).

### Free Licensing

While Nessus does have a free community version available, we must request it from #Tenable. If you go to the Activation Code page on the official Nessus site, you can register for Nessus Essentials and request an Activation Code.

#### Ubuntu Installation

In this example, HTB has provided the command line ( #CLI) commands for installing Nessus onto Ubuntu:

>dpkg -i Nessus-8.15.1-ubuntu910_amd64.deb

#### Starting Nessus

We can use the following command to start an instance of Nessus:

>sudo systemctl start nessusd.service

#### Accessing Nessus

Enter the following #URL into your browser:

>https://localhost:8834

This will reveal the setup page for Nessus Essentials. Enter the provided Activation Code to gain access.

Set up your Nessus account and create a secure password. After this step the plugins will compile. 

#### Nessus on HTB VM

In the case of our future modules, Nessus will already be installed. In order to access Nessus on these VMs, use the following URL and credentials:

>\https://10.10.10.10:8834

>u: htb-student
>p: HTB_\@cademy_student!

Once we have opened the Nessus app, we can work through the configuration settings to set up Nessus.
