# Metasploit Preface

There is a commonly encountered argument about the use of automated tools in penetration testing. 

There is one side that argues that using automated tools limits the understanding of the penetration tester and allows hacky amateurs to participate in the profession. Due to reliance on tools, they are not learning the correct manual methods for testing and therefore have gaps in knowledge that limit the potential of the tester. These people argue that putting pentesting tools into the public domain encourages malicious actors to use the tools and for amateurs to interact with target networks in ways they do not understand.

The opposing point of view is that these tools help testers understand more aspects of a target network than they would be able to do with purely manual testing. The automation is used to reveal information in a fast and detailed way, being performed while the tester is able to perform other tasks simultaneously.

Hack The Box holds the stance that the tools are important and useful as long as testers aren't too dependent on them and can be self-reliant when needed. They have the perspective that many creative outlets use automation to aid them, and penetration testing is no different. The United States National Security Agency ( #NSA) releases tools to the public, so clearly they support this side of the argument as well. 

In my own opinion, I don't think the availability of tools is a negative thing. While they can be abused, I think they are vital to the learning experience and for quickening the penetration testing process. As long as you account for the fact that automation may limit perspective if too heavily relied on, all should be okay.
