# Bourne Again Shell

Bourne Again Shell ( #BASH) is a scripting language for #Unix based operating systems ( #OS). It is also available for #Microsoft products since the advent of #Windows Subsystem for #Linux since 2019. A key distinction between a scripting language and a programming language is that programming languages must compile code while scripts can be executed instantly.

The main functions of a scripting language include:

- Input
- Output
- Arguments
- Variables
- Arrays
- Conditional Execution
- Arithmetic
- Loops
- Comparison Operators
- Functions

Scripts do not create processors, they are parsed into an interpreter that executes the script. When executing a script in BASH, we must specify the interpreter and designated script as seen in the varying syntax of the following commands:

>bash script.sh \<optional arguments>

>sh script.sh \<optional arguments>

>./script.sh \<optional arguments>

In the following command we will execute a script targeting the following domain:

>./CIDR.sh inlanefreight.com

This will reveal the subnetwork range for the domain.
