# Enumeration

#Enumeration can be summarized as collecting as much information as possible for a given subject or target. This is the most important part of security because if we don't know all the possible flaws or points of access within a network, we cannot thoroughly defend or attack it. 

Developing strong skills in enumeration means understanding the technologies, protocols, tools, applications, interfaces, operating systems, hardware, and more that are used in network technology.

The biggest portion of our information comes from misconfiguration of the target system and it's applications. These flaws most often stem from ignorance or naivety from a system administrator that is either not aware or doesn't believe it necessary to fully configure their security defenses.

Understanding the detailed workings of services and applications is even more important than understanding the tools used to exploit them. If we have thorough understanding of how these services work, we can manipulate them better with our tool set.
