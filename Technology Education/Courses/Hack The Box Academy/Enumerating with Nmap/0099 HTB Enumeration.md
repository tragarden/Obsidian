# Enumeration

#Enumeration can be summarized as **collecting as much information as possible for a given subject** or target. This is the ***most important part of #security*** because if we don't know all the possible flaws or points of access within a network, we cannot thoroughly defend or attack it. 

Developing strong skills in enumeration means **understanding the technologies, protocols, tools, applications, interfaces, operating systems, #hardware**, and more that are used in #network technology.

The biggest portion of **our information comes from misconfiguration of the target system and it's applications**. These flaws most often stem from ignorance or naivety from a system administrator that is either not aware or doesn't believe it necessary to fully configure their security defenses.

**Understanding the detailed workings of services and applications is even more important than understanding the tools used to exploit them**. If we have thorough understanding of how these services work, we can manipulate them better with our tool set.
