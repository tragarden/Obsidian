### Overview

Reflect on what you have learned throughout this course and apply this knowledge to understand how you might approach different roles and tasks within the security field.

Ask yourself these two questions: How would I exploit this vector? Consider the vectors and attack surfaces available to you.

- What are the physical and digital attack surfaces within a home? What are the vulnerabilities and are they currently exposed to risk?

The attack surfaces within my home are my home network including wireless network, router, and switch, as well as my windows and doors. The windows are often left unlocked so this exposes means of entry. My home network is relatively secured, but I do host a lot of IoT devices like lightbulbs and entertainment devices that could be accessed with relative ease. I did put them on their own subnet in an attempt to prevent this. 

- What are the attack vectors on this surface and how many entry points are there? What defenses already exist and how could they be improved?

There are four windows that could be entered if an attacker were to attempt entry. I think these are reasonably sized so that a human could fit through them. Regularly locking my windows when we are out of the house or sleeping could improve this security. My home network should be pretty secure unless there is a way that an attacker could hack my IoT devices and move from my IoT subnet into my main network. I use strong passwords for my main wireless network that I believe would be resistant to brute force attacks. If someone physically logged into my PC while my password manager was active, they would have full control over all of my accounts, networks, and devices. I use a 15 minute sleep setting on my computer and turn it off when I am not home to combat this from happening.
