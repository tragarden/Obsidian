### Overview

Review a data risk assessment and determine if appropriate data handling processes are currently implemented. Ensure that the proper combination of technical, operational, and managerial controls have been implemented while embracing the concept of principle of least privilege.

### Scenario

You work for an educational technology company that developed an application that automatically grades assignments. This app collects data from academies, instructors, parents, and students. An investigatory team announced a data leak of internal business plans via social media. An employee accidentally shared this information with customers and now an audit is required to determine methods for prevention.

You have been granted information related to the leak and it is evident that the principle of least privilege has not been observed during a sales meeting. Evaluate the details related to this incident and determine methods for prevention and protection of information privacy. Justify your recommendations. 

### Project

Issues: A Customer Success representative gained access from their manager to a folder containing internal business documents related to new products. These products included Personally Identifiable Information like customer analytics and business information like marketing materials. The manager did not unshare the folder after this interaction. The CS representative accidentally linked the entire folder to a customer while performing a sales call. This customer then posted the folder contents on their social media page.

Review: The NIST CSF must be considered as we continue to address these issues. This would be an efficient method of organizing data and protect against future data leaks. Furthermore the NIST SP 800-53 AC-6 provides clear plans for implementing security controls and enhancing current controls. 

Recommendations: Based on the NIST provisions there are best practices that should be observed by the organization. The Principle of Least Privilege should be abided by and assessed across the organization. This will be useful in limiting user access throughout the organization and revoking privileged access when it is no longer needed. Logging and annual auditing of user privileges must be enforced to ensure secure possession of data.

Justification: Applying the Principle of Least Privilege will limit the possible outroads for data leak by reducing the amount of users that have access to this content. Logging will reveal and track any leaks in a methodical way. An annual audit of privileges will address privilege creep throughout the organization.
