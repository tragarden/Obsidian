# Security Audit for Botium Toys

Botium Toys is a small business operating from a single brick and mortar location that is used as their main office, storefront, and warehouse. Their IT department is facing pressure to support an ever growing online presence that is looking to expand to a global audience.

The IT manager wants to conduct an internal audit to ensure continuity of business and compliance with the EU as the business expands. Main goals are to secure company infrastructure and identify and mitigate risks, threats, and vulnerabiliites to high-risk assets. This will heavily inolve the processing of credit card payments and international transactions.

The manager wants to employ NIST CSF frameworks to establish scope and goals while listing assets of the IT department. A risk assessment will be completed to provide overview of the risks and fines that come with expansion.

My job is to review the scope, goals, and report from the risk assessment before performing an internal audit of the controls and compliance by creating a checklist. Provide recommendations for the IT manager.

### Scope

All aspects of the company are to be assessed and audited. All policies, procedures, and processed should be evaluated to determine if current implementations abide by regulatory agencies both domestic and foreign. The entire IT and security team should face scrutiny and assessment during this audit. 

### Goals

Botium Toys wants to fully assess all assets and security controls via compliance checklists to ensure that best practices and regulatory standards are adhered to. The company wants to improve and remediate it's security posture to ensure compliance with international sales laws and to protect customers and employees from threats, risks, and vulnerabilities. Achieving a strong security posture and ensuring all compliance laws are abided by is of great importance during this audit.

## Controls Checklist

Botium Toys MUST IMPLEMENT the following security controls and policies TO BE WITHIN COMPLIANCE OF REGULATIONS:

### LACK OF COMPLIANCE IN SECURITY MEASURES

- Principle of Least Privilege is needed.
- Disaster Recovery Plan needs to be drafted
- Strengthen Password Policy via centralized password management that enforces minimum requirements for secure passwords.
- Separation of duties must be implemented to reduce and restrict access where needed.
- Intrusion Detection System ( #IDS) needs to be installed and configured
- Backups for configurations and data must be created and properly configured.
- Create Schedule for monitoring and maintaining legacy systems and define intervention methods. Consider automated software in addition to manual monitoring and maintenance. 
- Encryption methods must be implemented and enforced to be in compliance with EU GDPR and PCI DSS regulations.
- Password Management system must be implemented and properly configured.

### LACK OF COMPLIANCE WITH PCI DSS

- ALL USERS have access to PCI DSS protected data which is a MASSIVE VIOLATION OF COMPLIANCE and subject to penalties and fines by INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS AND REGULATIONS. Personally Identifiable Information ( #PII ) is VULNERABLE and AT RISK to human social engineering and internal threat. 
- Credit Card data is NOT SECURE as all employees have access to this data and policies and protocols must be enforced to protect this data.
- Encryption methods ARE NOT IMPLEMENTED and all transaction points within the organization MUST BE IMPLEMENTED, CONFIGURED, AND ENFORCED to ensure compliance with PCI DSS regulations, standards, and laws.
- Secure password policies ARE NOT IMPLEMENTED posing a risk of external and internal threats exfiltrating data and the possibility of identity theft is high.

### LACK OF COMPLIANCE WITH GDRP 

- Customer data IS NOT PRIVATE OR SECURE.

### LACK OF COMPLIANCE WITH SOC

- Access Policies HAVE NOT BEEN IMPLEMENTED.
- Sensitive data is NOT CONFIDENTIAL OR PRIVATE. All employees have access to all PII and SPII data causing a high-risk scenario.
- 

### Compliance Status

CURRENTLY Botium Toys IS NOT COMPLIANT with regulatory standards of any nature, including EU GDRP and PCI DSS regulations which could result in international penalties, fines, reputational decline, and loss of high-risk assets. High-risk assets are exposed in a variety of ways exposing the company to various legal, financial, reputational, internal, and external threats. While some implementations of security controls within the organization may adhere to organization standards for security - there is no adherence to PCI DSS regulations and laws.

### CONTROLS THAT ARE CURRENTLY COMPLIANT

Botium toys has successfully implemented the following controls which ARE COMPLIANT:

#### General Security

- Firewall is properly configured and active, and monitored.
- Antivirus software is properly configured, active, and monitored.
- Physical Locks are properly installed and maintained.
- CCTV is installed and active.
- Fire Detection and Prevention systems are active and maintained.

#### GDRP

- There is an existing plan to notify EU customers within 72 hours if their PII data is compromised or the company network is otherwise breached.
- Data is properly classified and monitored by the IT staff.
- Privacy policies, procedures, and processes are properly enforced and established by the security team. 

#### SOC

- Data integrity has been ensured to make sure data is consistent, complete, accurate, and validated.
- Authorized individuals have access to data and availability is ensured by staff. 

### Summary

Lack of compliance and implementation of security best practices poses a major risk to the company and many measures will need to be taken in order to become compliant to local and international compliance laws and regulations. High-Risk assets are vulnerable to threats and could easily be compromised to external threats, internal threats, or social engineering. Password management, Intrusion Detection Systems ( #IDS), encryption standards, principle of least privilege, separation of duties, scheduling, and backups MUST BE IMPLEMENTED TO BECOME COMPLIANT TO LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS, LAWS, AND REGULATIONS. A Disaster Recovery plan MUST BE CREATED to address the HIGH LIKELIHOOD of threat actors exfiltrating private and protected data such as #SPII and cardholder information. A lack of Preventative, Corrective, Detective, and Deterrent security controls MUST BE REMEDIATED IMMEDIATELY before business can be safely conducted without threat of regulatory or legal actions against the company.
