# Career Identity

Career Identity can be described as the unique set of skills and ideas that define you in a workplace. Rather than being homogenous, you can use these unique traits to stand out and offer a notably different perspective.

In the video provided, she describes herself as being adept at distilling complex ideas into plain language that a laymen could understand - I think I share this strength with her.

### Writing a Career Identity Statement

Writing a statement about who you are can really help you understand where your abilities stand out and what sets you apart from others. This statement should be composed of three components:

- Strengths - activities that strengthen you. This might be skills you have developed like boat detailing, programming, gardening, or traits that you have such as socially adept, careful listener, or deep thinker.

- Motivations - derived from your passions and your purpose in life. She describes herself as a storyteller, which I can definitely relate to.

- Values - values are the things that you hold dearly and are principles that you live by and strive for. This could be honesty, integrity, helping others, making a positive impact, and many more.

### Question Prompts

Ask yourself the following questions:

- What skills, knowledge, and talents make me stand out?
- What motivates me to do things?
- What are my key values that I cannot detach myself from?

Interviewing friends and family can be a useful way to gain insights about who you are and what your main characteristics are.

A basic template for our statement is provided by the video:

>I am a ( role ) with ( years ) of experience doing ( accomplishment ). My greatest strength is ( strength ), and I have a talent for ( strength ). I am passionate about ( motivation ), and I value ( value ).
