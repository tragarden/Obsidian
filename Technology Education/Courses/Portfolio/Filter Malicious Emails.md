### Overview

I will analyze suspicious emails and identify signs of phishing before determining if an email should be allowed or quarantined. 

### Scenario

I work for Imaginary Bank as a security analyst investigating a phishing email emulating official bank emails that was sent to an executive. This official looking email encouraged the executive to install collaboration software called ExecuTalk. The executive is suspicious because he doesn't recognize the name of this software and it was not mentioned in any recent meeting and wants you to determine if it is a legitimate email. Determine whether it should be accepted or quarantined.

### Project 

Notes:

 - The first thing that I notice is that this email is send from gmail.org instead of gmail.com.
 - It was sent on a Saturday outside of office hours.
 - There are obvious typos throughout the email.
