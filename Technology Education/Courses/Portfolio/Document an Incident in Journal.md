### Overview

I will review a security incident and record relevant information in my Incident Handler's Journal to document the incident response process. This is an appropriate place for additional thoughts, reflections, and any other notes you find relevant to the experience of building your portfolio.

### Scenario

I'm reviewing a security incident for a small US health care clinic that delivers primary care services. On Tuesday at about 09:00 employees reported that they were unable to access medical records with their workstations which resulted in a shutdown of business operations. Employees were unable to access files and software involved in standard operations and that a ransom note was displayed on their desktops. 

The ransom note stated that their systems' files were encrypted by a group of hackers that target healthcare and transportation industries. The note stated that money payment must be provided in order to decrypt these files.

This attack was perpetrated by the hackers via targeted phishing emails sent to several employees within the company that contained malicious attachments that installed malware after download. Hackers were then able to gain access and deploy ransomware that was able to encrypt files that are critical for standard operations. This resulted in the organization shutting down all systems before contacting third parties to report the incident and gain assistance.
