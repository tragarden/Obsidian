#### Reflection

1. Were there any specific activities that were challenging for you? Why or why not?
	- I found the Wireshark activity difficult because the Virtual Machine for the activity did NOT have Wireshark installed which caused problems for the entire project. After discussing this with a Coursera employee I was able to resolve the issue. The activities themselves were all straightforward and pretty easy.
    
2. Has your understanding of incident detection and response changed since taking this course?
    - Seeing how a portfolio can be assembled and participating in the Incident Handler's Journal was a nice experience that helped me document my process and work. I have been doing security projects for several years now and wish I had documentation for all of my projects.
3. Was there a specific tool or concept that you enjoyed the most? Why?
	- I liked using Suricata as I was unfamiliar with that tool and learning new things is my favorite aspect of any educational course.

This proved to be malicious content that posed a threat to the orgnization. The domain 'misecure' was closely related to this malware. |
