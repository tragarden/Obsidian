### Overview

I will analyze Wireshark and tcpdump in a comparison exercise to identify similar and different features of the applications. 

### Scenario 

For my cybersecurity analyst role I will research the difference between Wireshark and tcpdump and complete a Venn diagram to illustrate the differences.

  

Wireshark

- Uses Graphical User Interface ( #GUI)
- Consumes more system resources
- Provides colored entries for filtering results
- Advanced Network Interfaces
- Has complex filtering methods
- Can decode captured packets
- Better for detailed analysis
- Less scripting and automation capabilities


tcpdump

- Uses Command-Line Interface ( #CLI)
- Consumes less system resources
- Can export packet captures to text files 
- Uses more conventional interfaces
- Has simple filtering methods
- Better for quick scans
- Strong scripting and automation potential

Similarities

- Network Protocol Analyzers
- Free and Open Source
- Packet Capturing tools
- Variety of Filters
- Variety of Protocols
