### Overview

I am conducting a vulnerability assessment for the security systems of a small business to evaluate risks and develop a remediation plan of action.

### Scenario

I am contracted to assess the security status of an e-commerce company that uses remote database servers to facilitate remote workers globally. These employees frequently query data from the databases to discover clients. This database is publicly available for the past three years since the launch of the company which poses a severe vulnerability. I will perform this vulnerability assessment and relay potential risks via written report for the executives of the company. This report will explain the vulnerability of the server, risk to operations, and methods for securing the database.

### Project 

#### System

128GB RAM
Powerful CPU
Linux OS
MySQL Database
IPv4 addressing
Various servers on the network
SSL/TLS encryption

#### Scope

Access controls of this system must be evaluated.
Evaluation occurs over a 3 month period from June to August.
Use NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 as a framework for analysis.

#### NIST SP 800-30 Rev 1

This document provides guidelines for risk assessment outlining methods for identifying, analyzing, and remediating risks. It helps users determine the likelihood and severity of risks so they can make informed decisions about appropriate remediation methods. 

Risks fall into the categories of human, technological, and environmental. 

Threats are identified as sources that can exploit existing vulnerabilities that could potentially damage organization systems.

Likelihood is either high, moderate, or low and this is based on factors like evidence and judgement of the assessor.

Severity estimates the possible affect on the operations of the organization - is it a minor or temporary interruption, an ongoing problem, or a complete shutdown of operations?

#### Purpose

Hypothetical reference questions:
- How is this database valuable to the organization?
- Why must this database be secured?
- If the server were compromised, how would this affect standard operations?

This e-commerce business is highly reliant on the database server in question. It provides resources to all employees and facilitates remote work, which applies to most employees. Securing the database is of high importance because any downtime prevents the employees from sourcing clients and will effectively prevent them from working. If this server were disabled, all standard organizational procedures would come to a halt which dramatically affects their ability to do business as usual. Stakeholders should be concerned about this vulnerability as it is publicly available and prone to injection style attacks and data exfiltration by threat actors.

#### Risk Assessment

| Threat Source | Threat Event | Likelihood | Severity | Risk |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Hacker  | Denial of Service Attack | 3 | 2 | 6 |
| Hacker or APT | Sensitive Data exfiltration | 2 | 2 | 4 |
| Employee | Man-in-the-middle attacks | 2 | 1 | 2 |
| Storage or Network failure | Disrupt Mission Critical Operations | 1 | 3 | 3 |
| Power Supply failure | Disrupt Mission Critical Operations | 2 | 3 | 6 |

#### Approach

In the risk assessment I chose to assess threat actor attacks and hardware failure since I believe these would be either likely to occur or have significant impact on organization operations. Due to the public access of the servers, I believe that threat actors have a high likelihood of of exploiting vulnerabilities in the network to access or disable servers. This could be in the form of a DoS attack that consumes network bandwidth or via exfiltration or manipulation of data in or in transit from the database. Internal device failure is possible but less likely than external actors. If these were to occur however, they would significantly impact or completely cease standard operations. A power failure or network failure would render all operations inoperable until addressed.
#### Remediation

I would first suggest applying the principles of Defense in Depth to address the security of the databases and secure it from external threat actors. Applying perimeter safeguards like Multi-Factor Authentication and Access Control would be a great first step at preventing external access. Abiding by the Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting ( #AAA) framework would be a great method of securing the database. Acquiring means of backup via cloud services would be advised to circumvent any hardware failures until technicians are able to repair physically failed devices. Applying Public Key Infrastructure ( #PKI) to existing encryption methods would further secure the database from exfiltration of data.
