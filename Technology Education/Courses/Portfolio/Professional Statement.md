# Professional Statement

I am a cybersecurity ethical hacker who has strong analytical. organizational, and communicative skills. I value abiding by ethical practices and ensuring that users of the internet and networks are secure and protected from attacks. I am deeply interested in Linux-based work and penetration testing.

I am constantly interested in learning new technology related knowledge and developing my hobby interest into a career. I think that my true interest in the subject supersedes others' pursuit of a career or money. I have a genuine interest in network technology beyond making a job out of it - I do it because I truly want to know.

I have also applied concepts I learned from my college engineering education to the concepts of networking, cybersecurity, ethical hacking, automation, home server, programming, electronics, and many other facets of technology.

Beyond technical skills, I am also naturally personable and a great communicator. I find it easy to translate difficult concepts into simpler language that laymen and technical experts can appreciate. I always consider my audience and rarely speak over the heads of those I am addressing.
