# Obsidian Plug-ins

### Plug-in types

There are two types of plug-ins associated with Obsidian:
	- Core plug-ins are included with the application and known to be secure.
	- Third-party plug-ins are produced by users in the Obsidian community.

While the core plug-ins are useful, there are many third-party options that perform beyond the limitations of the core plug-ins.  In order to install these third-party options, safe mode must be disabled, which is a security risk. *Please investigate any third-party downloads before installing!*

***Ctrl + P*** is the hotkey to open the plug-ins menu.



### Suggested plug-ins

1. **Mind Map** simply displays a hierarchal tree or map that shows the pathing between related folders and file. 

2. **Sliding Panes (Andy's Mode)** enables you to use Shift + Mouse Wheel to scroll through any panes you currently have open.  

3. **Hotkeys++** has a few functions, the one I am most interested in from this lesson turns multiple lines into a list with bullets or numbers.  This is (currently) bound to (ctrl + 4).

4. **Better Word Count** will tell you the total word count for a highlighted section of text.  This updates in real-time and works in conjunction with the Obsidian word counter. An example of why this is useful would be breaking paragraphs of text into 240 character strings for creating Tweets.

5. **Smart Random Note** - Eric Hall selects a random note within Obsidian.  This is useful for finding inspiration from the past and sparking a rabbit hole on a topic you may not have touched in awhile. 

6. **Advanced Tables - Tony Grosinger** allows you to create Markdown tables via a combination of the pipe ( \| ) and tab completion. Example below:

| titles      | hair  | coom   | hat | fable |
| ----------- | ----- | ----- | --- | ----- |
| first title | brown | white | big | no    |


7. **Paste URL into Selection - Denis Olehov** allows you to highlight text that you would like to turn into a hyperlink and quickly attach a copied URL.  It can also prompt you to submit a daily note that updates your progress and incomplete tasks, as well as a weekly review of your notes.

8. **Calendar - Liam Cain** will show the amount of work you completed per day in (default) 250 word increments on a calendar within a menu.

9. **Natural Language Dates - Argentina Ortega Sainz** takes phrases from the language used (today, tomorrow, in two weeks) and converts them to the numerical date they otherwise subjectively represent.

10. **Review - Ryan J.A. Murphy** can save a specified note and prompt you to review this note at a specific date assigned by the user.

11. **Note Refactor - James Lynch** takes a highlighted header and all that is contained within it, and exports the text within to a new note. A link to the new note is created in place of where the header used to be, breaking one large note into smaller parts.
