# Motherboard Connectors 3.4

### Pin Layouts

*24-pin motherboard power* is a standard for motherboard power, **providing +3.3V, +/-5V, and +/-12V rates of power**.  Originally, ATX boards used 20 pin power connectors, eventually switching to the 24-pin standard when PCIe cards needed more power.  Luckily **24 pin connectors are backwards compatible with their 20-pin counterparts**, even if the connector size is larger.  Some cables come in a **20-pin + 4-pin modular form factor** for this reason.

These connectors are *asymmetrical to prevent incorrect installation* – their housing will not insert into the slot on the motherboard as their shapes are not congruent. 

*4-pin #ATX connectors* supply additional **+12V power via ATX12V Advanced Technology Extended Motherboards**.  Older motherboards may be able to use this as additional power for the #CPU. The connector may be labeled as **ATX12V, P4, or CPU and once again is asymmetrical** to create a ‘key’ that matches an appropriate connector.

An #eSATA card can be added to your machine to use external drives.

*Pin Headers* are basic **interfaces for electrical interfacing** – some connectors fit onto the pins to supply power, peripherals, lights, and buttons. Some of these are labeled to receive various formats of #USB. 

*Front Panel connectors* are simple two wire connectors that **supply power to features built into the faceplate** of the desktop tower case, usually for lights, power switch, USB interfaces or ROM drives.

*M.2 connector* is a more modern standard that can receive an #SSD of that form factor.
