# Motherboard Expansion Slots 3.4

### Motherboards

When you look down upon a #motherboard, Professor Messer compares this to a birds-eye view of a city of technology.  All these structures must be connected via pathways like a sidewalk, and these routes are located on the bottom of the motherboard in a complex set of connections referred to as a computer bus.   This is the communication path for all devices within the motherboard.  The **buses are recognized as pins**, and the **lines connecting them are known as traces**.

### PCI

*Peripheral Component Interconnect* ( #PCI) was created in 1994 and allows for many forms of expansion with the availability of **32-bit and 64-bit buses capable of #parallel communication**.  **64-bit PCI slots are notably larger** than their 32-bit counterparts.  Expansion cards that fit in these slots should have their own slots that indicate the **capability of 3.3V power or 5V power**, some with both. 

When a card is installed correctly, **you should not see any exposed contacts** on the card. 

*Peripheral Component Interconnect Express* ( #PCIe) is the modernized standard version of PCI slots.  It uses **unidirectional #serial lanes in an amount of x1, x2, x4, x8, x16, or x32 ‘full duplex lanes**’ where the ‘x’ is pronounced ‘by’. If you need more #bandwidth, you will need more lanes to increase the volume of communication happening.
