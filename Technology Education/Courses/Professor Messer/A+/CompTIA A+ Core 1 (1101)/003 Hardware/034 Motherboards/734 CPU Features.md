# CPU Features 3.4

### Operating Systems

The difference between **32-bit and 64-bit** *operating systems* ( #OS) is quite vast – while **32-bit processors can store about 4GB** worth of values, a ***64-bit processor can store 17 BILLION GB*** worth of values.  These 17B values are somewhat conceptual, and your **OS will have a limiting factor** for a maximum supported number of values.  ***32-bit is indicated by (x86) and 64-bit is indicated by (x64)***.

Hardware drivers are specific to the type of processor you have, 64-bit and 32-bit are not compatible with each other.  ***64-bit programs WILL NOT run on a 32-bit system***.  

### ARM

*Advanced #RISC Machine* ( #ARM) is a #CPU **architecture that was licensed by Arm** ltd., allowing others to manufacture the design they made.  It is a *low power device* that is an efficient processor while still being fast.  Its original use was **mainly for #IoT devices and mobiles**.

### Processors

Processors have several components incorporated into their design.  A single #processor may have **many cores, and each core may contain its own cache**.  Alternatively, the chip may use a shared #cache that all cores use.  The cache helps speed up the process of **importing and exporting data from the processor core**.

### Multi-threading

**Hyper-Threading Technology** ( #HTT), otherwise known as #Multithreading, allows you to **divide the processing power of one CPU so that it acts like two separate units**. Your operating system must support this and an ***output increase from this is about 15% to 30%***. 

### Virtualization

#Virtualization support comes in the form of **multiple operating systems sharing hardware components**.  This is taxing on hardware and performance may be limited by intense virtualization. This process **makes hardware faster and more manageable**.  #Intel *Virtualization Technology* ( #VT) and #AMD *Virtualization* ( #AMD-V) are the #proprietary software for these processes.
