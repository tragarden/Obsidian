# Motherboard Compatibility 3.4

### Determining Compatibility

When determining what parts you would choose for a computer build, the *Computer Processing Unit* ( #CPU) is the ***most important variable*** as it determines compatibility for the entire system.  #Intel and #AMD are the two choices for processors, with AMD generally being seen as cost effective versus Intel being valued for performance, although this has changed over time. The **motherboard you choose will be designed for the CPU you chose** – you CANNOT install the opposite brand after you have committed to a #motherboard or processor. 

### Motherboard Type

#### Server Motherboards

*Server Motherboards* have **multiple sockets for CPUs in order to load balance** when traffic is high, this is known as a *multi-socket motherboard*.  They support **at least 4 memory slots and typically have a variety of expansion** slots of various sizes.  These are typically #ATX boards and are fairly large, they are **often incorporated into a rack** mounted system.

#### Desktop Motherboards

*Desktop motherboards* range in size depending on the application.  Desktops will typically use ATX motherboards while **all-in-one units** may use a smaller #ITX board. These boards have **one CPU socket and up to 4 memory slots**.  Many expansion slots are possible.

#### Mobile Motherboards

*Mobile motherboards* are built for a **small and light, portable form factor** so they can be used in laptops and devices with limited internal space.  They **lack a modular design** in most cases, but still offer some modification of the #memory and #storage devices.

#### Mobile System Boards

*System boards* for laptops and mobile devices are **often proprietary in design** so that they can be snugly fit into the device.  There are **limited options for replacement** as most components on the board cannot be repaired or replaced, and if you replace the entire board, you must use the exact board that the device was manufactured with.
