# Expansion Cards 3.4

### Card Types

#Expansion cards are a #modular and convenient way to **add functionality to your device**.  It is as simple as acquiring the hardware, slotting it, fastening a screw, and then downloading the appropriate drivers and software. 

#### Sound

Sound Cards allow for **increased #audio quality for both microphone and speakers, as well as additional inputs and outputs**.  These are needed if you use an amp, microphones, podcast mixers, recording technologies, and jacks.

While some CPUs contain integrated GPUs, a discrete Graphics Processing Unit ( #GPU) is often required for videogames, design software, simulations, and video processing.  Having a separate processor for graphics **allows for higher performance and takes load off your CPU**.

#### Capture

#Capture Cards **allows you to collect #video input** in a high-performance way without straining your processor.  It uses a #PCIe Express connection and supports very high bandwidths.  These are **required for anyone that is live streaming or recording video** from their computer GUI.

*Serial Digital Interface* ( #SDI) allows for high end video capture via bayonet connector.
 
#### Network

*Network Interface Card* ( #NIC) is a #network device used to connect #ethernet to a device, and may afford other connections for a #router, server, and #firewall. 

#### Compatibility

To verify that hardware is compatible with your motherboard, **look into the documentation from the manufacturer for specs and compatibility notes**. 

***Most drivers are out of date by the time hardware reaches your hands***, so make sure to head to their website to acquire the most recent drivers. You can **uninstall the old drivers via Windows Device Manager**.
