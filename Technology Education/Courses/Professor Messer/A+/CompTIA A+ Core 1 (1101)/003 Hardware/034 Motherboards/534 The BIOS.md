# Basic Input / Output System

### BIOS

*Basic Input / Output System* ( #BIOS) is the **firmware that is used to start your computer**.  These come in a few forms such as *Read Only Memory* ( #ROM) BIOS **in the form of media**, *System BIOS* that is **coded into your motherboard**, or #flash memory **inserted into a drive** in the device. ***BIOS initiates the processor and RAM to begin building and presenting the GUI***.  Then the **BIOS will look for your #boot loader to initialize the operating system**.

### POST

*Power-On Self-Test* ( #POST) checks to see if you have **active memory, processing power, video signal, and peripherals.** 

If there is *flash memory* integrated into your motherboard to store the BIOS data, this is **often accompanied by a second backup flash storage**, giving you the option of upgrading your BIOS while still maintaining a backup of the original. 

### Legacy BIOS

#Legacy BIOS is over 25 years old and older systems had to communicate with their hardware via BIOS **without the ability to directly access hardware**.  There were **no drivers for this hardware** at the time. You can make very minor configurational changes via legacy BIOS.

### UEFI

*Unified Extensible Firmware Interface* ( #UEFI) is based on the #EFI created by #Intel.  This **replaced the legacy BIOS** and is a modern standard across all manufacturers as a modern BIOS for modern computing systems.  It has both **graphical and text-based interfaces**.
