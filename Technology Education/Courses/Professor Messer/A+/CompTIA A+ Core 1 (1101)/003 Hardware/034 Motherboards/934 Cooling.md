# Cooling 3.4

### Fans

*Case fans* are necessary in a computer case to **draw cool air from the outside over the hot internal parts, and then exhaust the hot air out of the system** while having good airflow. When airflow is considered, you must evaluate the motherboard layout, location of components, wiring, power source, component size, and vent sizes.

**Some adapter cards will have their own on-board fan**, common on video cards and processors. Sometimes heat sinks are used in conjunction with fans for more cooling.

Fan specifications come in standards like **80mm, 120mm, 200mm**, as well as various speed settings and noise levels. Larger fans can move more air while making less noise.

### Passive Cooling

#Passive cooling does not utilize fans, but rather *inanimate heat sinks*. Without fans, these are noiseless devices and are usually designed for areas that need to be quiet like near a TV or speakers.  These devices are put through vigorous and intense testing by the manufacturer to ensure that no matter how much you demand from the machine, it will not overheat.

*Heat Sinks* are **blocks of copper or aluminum that are machined to have many fins or grids to increase the surface area and dissipate the heat through thermal conduction**.  These get extremely hot so avoid them if your device has recently been running.  They must be secured to the intended space with thermal pasted due to these temperatures.

#### Thermal Paste and Pads

*Thermal Paste* is sometimes called *thermal grease or conductive grease* and is used as a **thermally conductive adhesive in technology applications**.   A pea-sized amount applied between your component and the heat sink is more than adequate for securing the two surfaces.  The paste **improves thermal conductivity of the two surfaces to export the heat** out of the heat sinks faster. 

*Thermal Pads* are an **alternative to thermal paste that is easier to install but must be reinstalled more frequently** than thermal paste would be applied.  It is very easy to use and only involves cutting it to size and then sticking it on to the intended mating surfaces.  There is **no chance of leakage** and while slightly less conductive than thermal paste, it is very close to the same performance.

### Liquid Cooling

*Liquid cooling* is when you have tubing that circulates coolant throughout a computer.  This is similar to automotive #cooling systems and has been around since the advent of mainframe computers. High performance systems benefit from liquid cooling, and many people with overclocked systems or computers built for gaming will opt for liquid cooling.
