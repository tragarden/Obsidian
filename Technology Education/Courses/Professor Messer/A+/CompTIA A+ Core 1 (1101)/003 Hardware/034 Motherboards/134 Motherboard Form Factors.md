# Motherboard Form Factors 3.4

### Motherboards

Motherboards come in many different *form factors* of **different physical size, layout, and airflow**.  Power connectors for a #motherboard are quite standardized.  Wikipedia states that there are over 40 categories of motherboard types.

***CompTIA Exam Objectives*** will present scenarios about installing and configuring motherboards, Central Processing Units ( #CPU ), and various cards. You will be expected to choose the best motherboard for the scenario, and knowing size specs is not as important as knowing #ATX or #ITX technologies.

Example: Choose a motherboard for the following: media center / video editing / laptop.

*Standard-ATX* boards are familiar to anyone who has looked inside of a desktop PC tower case.  These have **many slots and functions and are somewhat large**.  The name is *Advanced Technology Extended* ( #ATX) which was standardized by Intel in 1995. The power may be supplied by a **20 pin or 24 pin connector**, with some having the option of an additional 4/8 pin connector.

*Mini-ITX* boards are much smaller and come with less functionality, making them **useful in devices like televisions and valued mainly for their size**.  These are **low-power** devices developed by VIA Technologies in 2001.  Hardware from the ATX boards is compatible with ITX boards.
