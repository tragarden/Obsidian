# Memory Technologies 3.2

### VRAM

*Virtual Memory* or *Virtual RAM* ( #VRAM) is when a **small amount of your #HDD or #SSD is used as *Random Access Memory*, taking some of the workload from your actual #RAM**.  The SSD is much slower than actual RAM, so this is really used as a temporary way to store RAM data that is needed but not actively being used. This process is typically managed by your operating system. 

*Dual/Triple/Quad-Channel* refers to the amount of RAM slots your motherboard has, allowing for one #DIMM unit per channel.  This means you could have 4 x 64GB DIMM units on one system, as long as they are exact (or at least close) matches. 

#Memory that checks itself is used when running virtual machine servers, database servers, or even servers that host a website or #DNS.  It uses *Parity Memory*, which **will not always detect errors and cannot correct them** if they occur. 

*Error Correcting Code* ( #ECC) is capable of **detecting errors and correcting them**.  It looks the same as other self-checking memory, but not all systems are compatible with this type.

A *parity bit* is used to **create even parity among the 8-bits clustered together**.  There **needs to be an even number of ‘1’s in the binary** that makes up the 8-bits to ensure even pairing.  The **parity bit adds ‘1’ after the 8-bits in the case that there is an uneven amount of ‘1’s**.

***An error is detected in the case that there is an uneven amount of ‘1’s after the parity bit has been added.  An uneven amount of ‘1’s indicates an error.***
