# Memory Overview 3.2

### RAM

*Random Access Memory* ( #RAM) is the **most common form of memory** but is not the only type. 

There is a common misconception that ‘ #memory’ refers to #SSD or drive-based storage like hard drives.  These are data devices and permanently store data, which RAM and computer memory in general does NOT do.

***RAM stores temporary data, processing information, and programs while they are actively being used***.  It is one of the most important hardware components and **makes your computer faster**. 

Memory slots have changed with time as new technology and speeds have been introduced.  Most recent laptops all have the same slots now, reaching a point of standardization although all motherboards are different and may have different slots.

#### Memory Types

*Dual Inline Memory Module* ( #DIMM) has **two separate and unique sets of electrical contacts** on either side of an intentional gap in the device.  They transmit data in and out of the DIMM via **64-bit data width**.

*Small Outline Dual In-Line Memory Module* ( #SO-DIMM) is about **half the width of a DIMM** and is used in laptops and mobile devices.

The **black components** you see on DIMM and SO-DIMM units **are the ram components**, which serve as the memory for the DIMM.  We **refer to this as** *Dynamic RAM* ( #D-RAM), as it **must be constantly refreshed**, or the data will disappear.

The term ***Random Access*** is used because **any storage location can be directly accessed in a moment**, much unlike magnetic tape.

* #Synchronous D-RAM ( #SDRAM) **synchronizes with the system clock to queue** up one process while waiting for another to complete.

*Single Data Rate* ( #SDR) allows the **processing of one piece of data per clock cycle**, while *Double Data Rate* ( #DDR) is capable of **processing twice as much in the same period**. 

#DDR3 **doubled the data rate** of #DDR2 with larger chip capacities allowing for up to **16 GB per unit**. ***No backwards compatibility***.

#DDR4 has faster frequencies than DDR3, and up to **64GB per unit**. ***No backwards compatibility***.

#DDR5 allows for faster data transfer between the motherboard and the RAM with the same maximum rate as DDR4.  ***No backwards compatibility***.
