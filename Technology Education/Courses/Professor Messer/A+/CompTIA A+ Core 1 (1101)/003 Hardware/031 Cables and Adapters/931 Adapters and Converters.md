# Adapters and Converters 3.1

### Adapters

#Adapters are very commonly used and even the most thorough plans end up incorporating them to convert different connectors, such as #ethernet to #USB which is commonly needed for newer laptops that lack an #RJ45 port.  They may be temporarily or permanently integrated into your system.  You can find out what connectors are electrically compatible with each other when determining the correct adapters. #DVI-D and #HDMI are an example of **electrically compatible connectors** – this is an #analog to #digital connection where they are **backward compatible, require no signal conversion, and prevent data loss**.   #DVI-A is backwards compatible with #VGA. 

### Converters

#Converters are used to **convert an analog signal into a digital one**. USB hubs are common connectors that receive several or many connectors and transmit all their data via a single connector.
