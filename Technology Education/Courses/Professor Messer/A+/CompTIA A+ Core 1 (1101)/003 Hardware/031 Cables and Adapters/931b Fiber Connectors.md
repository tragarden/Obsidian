# Fiber Connectors 3.1

### Connector Types

#Fiber connections are preferable not only for speed, but because they **connect to a smaller port which allows for more usable space on the faceplate of a switch**.

*Local Connector 7* ( #LC7) cables have **two separate fiber connections**, one for inbound and one for outbound.

*Straight-Tip* ( #ST) connectors has **two long ferrules protruding from the end**, hence the name.  These are secure to the intended device via quarter turn and bayonet connection. 

*Subscriber Connector* ( #SC) is also known as the **square connector**, is often built as a single connector, although the **inbound and outbound cables can be separated and individually routed**.
