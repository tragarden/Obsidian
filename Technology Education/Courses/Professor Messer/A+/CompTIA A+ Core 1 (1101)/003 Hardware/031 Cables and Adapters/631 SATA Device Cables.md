# SATA DEVICE CABLES 3.1

#### SATA

*Serial AT Attachment* ( #SATA) cables **connect storage devices** inside and outside of your PC. 

- SATA 1.0 = 1.5 Gb/s
- SATA 2.0 = 3.0 Gb/s
- SATA 3.0 = 6.0 Gb/s
- SATA 4.0 = 16 Gb/s

#e-SATA = *external SATA*, matches any of the above versions

The SATA **power supply uses 15 pins**, and the **Data uses 7 pins**.  Sometimes with older power supplies, you will find that it does not have the 15 pin SATA port, and instead has an **older 4 pin #MOLEX connection**.  There is one power and one data cable per device.
