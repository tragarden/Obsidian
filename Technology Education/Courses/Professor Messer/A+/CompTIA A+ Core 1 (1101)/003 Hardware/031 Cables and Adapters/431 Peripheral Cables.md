# Peripheral Cables 3.1

*Universal Serial Bus* ( #USB) was designed to **simplify connections** for printers, storage drives, microphones, keyboards, mice, and much more.

*USB 1.1* had two modes, low speed 1.5 Mbit/s at 3m long, and **full speed 12 Mbit/s at 5m**.

*Standard-A, Standard-B, Mini-B, and Micro-B* were the available sizes.

*USB 2.0* transmitted **480 Mbit/s over a possible length of 5m**.

*Standard-A, Standard-B, Mini-B, and Micro-B* were the available sizes.

*USB 3.0* was known as ‘*superspeed*’ at **5 Gbit/s**.

While Standard-A plugs are still common, they are being **replaced by Standard-C**.

#USB-C has a lot of different connector pins on a #symmetric and **reversible** plug, replacing all previous versions of the USB standard ports.  This ***described the type of connector, not the type of signal***.

In July 2013, *USB 3.1 Gen 1* as released, changing the name of the standard.

*USB 3.1 Gen 2* is known as *SuperSpeed+* and ***doubles the throughput*** from 3.0 and 3.1. 

In September 2017, *USB 3.2 Gen 1* was released, once **again doubling bandwidth**.  This standard **uses an extra ‘lane’ for data via the ‘flip-flop’ wires** in USB-C cabling. 

#Thunderbolt cables are a **high-speed #serial connector** that is based on the *Mini DisplayPort* ( #MDP) standard.  These cables **transmit data and power**.

*Thunderbolt v1* had two channels at **10 Gbit/s per channel for a total of 20 Gbit/s**.

*Thunderbolt v2* had **20 Gbit/s on aggregated channels**.

*Thunderbolt v3* utilizes USB-C connectors to transmit **40 Gbit/s in a 3m copper cable**, or up to **60m on an optical fiber cable**.  You can **daisy chain up to 6 devices** using this standard.

*D-subminiature* ( #D-sub) cables refer to the connector size by name.  These are used for #RS-232 connections and have been an **industry standard since 1969**. These are used for #serial communication for modems, printers, mice, networking, and other uses.
