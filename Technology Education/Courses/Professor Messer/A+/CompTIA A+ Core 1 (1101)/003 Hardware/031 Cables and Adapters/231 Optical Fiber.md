# Fiber Optic 3.1

#Fiber communication is **transmission of data via light** on the visible spectrum.  An advantage to fiber is that it ***does not emit radio frequencies***, making it **very difficult to tap or monitor** this hardware and making the cable ***immune to RF interference***.  Fiber Optic signals can be **transmitted over much greater distances than traditional coaxial** cabling.

### Cable Construction

The **interior of the fiber optical cable is reflective**, which facilitates the movement of light from one end to the other.  An **LED creates a light ray that bounces through** the length of the cable.  The #core of the cable **has a high reflective index**.  The #cladding around the core has a **low reflective index**.  The cable is **encased in a mechanical protection**, known as a #buffer coating.

A #Ferrule is a **ceramic cap that goes on the end of the cable to protect the Fiber Core** within.  You can *identify the fiber core by looking at the ceramic ferrule and finding a small pale gray dot in the center*.

*Multi-mode fiber* uses an inexpensive light source to accomplish **short-range communications**.   It is known as multi-mode because one light can **produce multiple reflections within the fiber core**.

*Single-mode fiber* is used for **long-distance communications using an expensive laser** and a smaller and less reflective fiber core.  These can **traverse over 100km** without additional processing.
