# PATA Cables 3.1

### PATA

*Parallel AT Attachment* ( #PATA) is also known as **Parallel ATA or just #ATA**.  This was developed in 1999 via the PC/AT and used a **ribbon cable** for connection –now falling under the #legacy technology umbrella.  Originally it was named *Integrated Drive Electronics* ( #IDE) and then *Enhanced IDE* ( #EIDE).   These systems were developed by Western Digital and had speeds in the range of **16 MB/s through 133 MB/s**.

Some PATA cables are 40-wire, and some are 80-wire.  For **40-wire cables the first device connection is ‘Device 0’ followed by ‘Device 1’**, and the **opposite is true for an 80-wire cable which begins with ‘Device 1’ followed by ‘Device 0’**.

The **80-wire cables are used for higher bandwidth** as they have the same connectors, but twice as many wires, cutting down on crosstalk that occurs at higher speeds.  They are easily identified visually, and both connect to the same connectors.  Due to their symmetric shape, there is a **missing pin used to orient the direction of the cable** when inserted.  A notch is also included in the cable and connector designs for orientation when inserting. PATA connectors are VERY large compared to their more modern counterpart via SATA.
