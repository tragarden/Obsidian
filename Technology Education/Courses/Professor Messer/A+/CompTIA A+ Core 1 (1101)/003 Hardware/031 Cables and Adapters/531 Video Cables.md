# Video Cables 3.1

### Cable Types

*Video Graphics Array* ( #VGA) cables use a #DB-15 (or #DE-15) cable with a distinctive blue color, assigned by the *PC System Design Guide*.  It is **video only over an analog signal**, which means that ***image quality degrades after a cable length of 5 to 10 meters***.  This is a **15-pin connector**, which is unique as no other common cables use this number of pins.

*High-Definition Multimedia Interface* ( #HDMI) cables provide **video and audio via digital signal**.  These cables use a distinct and unique **19-pin Type A connector that is proprietary** and is not used for any other purposes.

#DisplayPort cables transmit **audio and video as digital data via packets**, like #ethernet or #PCI express.  It is **compatible with HDMI and DVI** if you have a passive adapter. 

*Digital Video Interface* ( #DVI) has **single and dual link video (no audio)** with 3.7 Gbit/s at 60fps via #single-link and 7.4 Gbit/s at 85 fps via #dual-link.

> #DVI-A is for analog signals.            
> #DVI-D is for digital.
> #DVI-I supports #analog and #digital.
