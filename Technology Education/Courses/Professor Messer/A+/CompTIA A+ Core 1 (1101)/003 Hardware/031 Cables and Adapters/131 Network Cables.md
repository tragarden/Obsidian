# Network Cables 3.1

Creating cable infrastructure is usually only done one time, so it must be thorough and free of errors during the initial implementation.  Most communication relies on cable connections, even in wireless systems. 

### Cable Types

*Twisted Pair Copper Cabling* utilizes **two wires with equal and opposite signals**, a positive and negative ***transmission wire***, and a positive and negative ***reception wire***.  These pairs are associated with a color, with the **positive wire being solid** and the **negative wire having white stripes** upon the solid color.

Since the wires are twisted, this means that the **signal is twisted as well**.  This design ensures that the wire is ***constantly moving away from the point of interference***.  #Interference is **identified when both wires reach their target destination, these signals are compared between the two wires which identifies any interference** that occurred.
- Different twist rates are used to differentiate between wires being used for different purposes.

#Coaxial cables are very common and are named so because there are **two or more forms of signal sharing a common axis**.  This uses an #RG-6 cable to transmit at high-speeds, the same cable that is used for a digital cable television signal. 

### Plenum

A #Plenum is a **designated area to receive and recirculate the forced air return**.  Ducting brings in a *Forced-Air Supply*, and other ducting serves as an exhaust for this Forced-Air.  Once you pass the return duct for the Forced-Air return there will be a *Plenum Airspace* **where all the cabling and hardware for the network will be stored**.  This is intended to ***prevent toxic smoke from forming in the case of a fire*** or worst-case scenario.  All this ducting and cabling occurs in what is known as a #drop-ceiling. 

*Plenum-Rated Cable* is reinforced cabling **designed for use in the Plenum** space.  There are multiple levels of reinforcement, including traditional *Polyvinyl Chloride* ( #PVC), *Fire-rated Fluorinated Ethylene Polymer* ( #FEP), and *Low-smoke PVC* options.  This cable ***will not be as flexible or have the same bend radius*** as less durable cabling. 

#Unshielded Twisted Pair ( #UTP) cabling is the **most common** type of cabling.

#Shielded Twisted Pair  #STP) cabling is **insulated to protect against interference**.  It may have individual shielding for each pair or a shield around the entire cable and **will include a ground wire** for extra protection.

### Nomenclature

There should be **information on the outside of the insulating case** around the wires including:

Abbreviations are used to denote the types of cable:

>U = Unshielded
>S = Braided Shielding
>F = Foil Shielding

Cable abbreviations come in the format: ***(Cable Type) / (Individual Pairs) TP***.

The nomenclature of #S/FTP indicates braided shielding around the entire cable and shielding around the twisted pairs.

The nomenclature of #F/UTP indicates foil shielding around the entire cable and no shielding around the twisted pairs.

### Underground Cabling

*Direct Burial STP* cables are **underground cables used when overhead cable systems are not viable**.  These are heavy duty and provide protection from weathering by being **waterproof, insulated with hydrophobic gel, and the shields and twists add rigidity and resistance to interference**.
