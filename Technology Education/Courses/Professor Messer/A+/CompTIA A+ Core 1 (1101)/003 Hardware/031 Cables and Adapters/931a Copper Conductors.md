# Copper Conductors 3.1

### Connectors

#RJ11 connectors are used for #telephone and #DSL connections and have **6 positions and 2 conductors**, which yields the name ( #6P2C).  The wires within the connector terminal **may not always be in the same positions**, and at times you will **see 4 conductors** ( #6P4C).  You will find these ports on a DSL #modem. 

#RJ45 connectors are a **modular connector that supports ethernet** connections.  They are found with **8 positions, 8 conductor configurations**.

#F-connectors are at the end of #coaxial cables and **connect your cable modem or television to the network** via *Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification*, or ( #DOCSIS).  The **connector is threaded** to ensure a secure connection to the device.

*Punch-Down Blocks* are patch panels that physically ‘punch’ or press wires into the **110-block structure**.  You will likely find these in data centers or large computer rooms.

#USB connectors of all varieties **are copper connectors**.

### Proprietary

#Molex connectors are **4-pin power connectors** made by the Molex Connector Company using ***AMP MATE-N-LOK*** technology, **providing +12V and +5V current**. These are used to connect many devices within your computer case. Your power supply will easily indicate whether you have a Molex compatible system or not.

#Apple #Lightning Cables and #DB-9 serial cables are also copper connectors.
