# SCSI Cables 3.1

### SCSI

*Small Computer Systems Interface* ( #SCSI pronounced ‘Scuzzy’) are really **not small** and allows you to link or #daisy-chain many #peripheral devices to a single cable.  This allows for **16 different devices** on one SCSI circuit.  There are many formats, such as **Fast, Ultra, Ultra-Wide, Ultra2, Ultra3, Ultra-320, Ultra-640, and ‘I’**.   It can support both #Serial and #Parallel ( #PATA) communications.

Formerly SCSI was used to connect scanners, tape drives, CD drives, etc. with **8 devices on a narrow bus** and **16 devices on a wide bus**. It is considered an intelligent interface, **configuring devices without user input**.  This system persists today and is a standard drive for virtual systems. 

There are ***MANY connector ends*** for SCSI systems.

Every SCSI device on a single bus has a **unique ID number** in the form of ***SCSI ID 0 (controller/computer), ID 2 (hard drive), ID 3 (CD-ROM)***.

*Logical Units* ( #LUN) are defined by and associated with each SCSI ID number, indicating separate drives.

At the end of the physical SCSI bus, the signal is terminated – which may be from a peripheral device or internal mechanisms within the device. 

*Serial Attached SCSI* ( #SAS) devices **have no terminators, configurations, or jumpers are needed to connect** with these devices.  This is one of the more recent developed technologies for SCSI.

Moving from PATA to SATA increases the throughput of the hardware via point-to-point connections.  These provide the speeds of a serial connection with no termination required.
