# Laser Printer Maintenance

### Toner Replacement

Replacing #toner cartridges is the most common maintenance performed on a printer.  This may also mean replacing the *Organic Photoconductor* ( #OPC) Drum.  Remove the packaging and protective plastic from the toner cartridge and replace it.  Make sure to power the device off first.  These cartridges may be accessed from the side or the top of the device.

Power the printer down before repairs, and make sure it has cooled as #fuser units become extremely hot.
### Page Count

Printers contain a **global counter of total pages printed** – the manufacturer will have a **number of prints designated as the time for maintenance**, similar to oil mileage on a car.  Wear and tear on a printer comes from many moving parts paired with heat and pressure.

Once you have reached enough prints to constitute maintenance, you can purchase a *maintenance kit* from the manufacturer.  These will **contain rollers, a fuser unit, and other parts that fail** over time.

### Calibration

#Calibration is sometimes needed after toner cartridge installation if the **image appears darker or lighter than the previous toner** cartridge. Calibration will adjust the density of the toner applied.  This may be a manual process per the user manual, while some printers have automated this process for you.

### Cleaning

A laser #printer cause a significant amount of dust due to their use of toner and paper.  They can be **cleaned with a damp cloth, or isopropyl alcohol** if needed. Isopropyl alcohol is useful for cleaning the rollers inside.  Do not use any harsh chemicals to clean your printers.  ***DO NOT use a vacuum or compressed air***.  If you get toner on your skin, **clean it with COLD water as warm water may activate the toner**.
