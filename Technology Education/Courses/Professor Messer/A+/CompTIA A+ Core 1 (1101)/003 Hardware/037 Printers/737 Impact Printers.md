# Impact Printers 3.7

#Dot-Matrix, or #Impact Printers **use a matrix of pins to physically press against an ink ribbon to make relief marks on paper** on the other side of the ink ribbon.  These units are useful for **low-resolution** solutions, but typically only fill niche roles due to their **loud noises and crude imaging**.

### Components

A *print head* is contained within a carriage that moves back and forth across the paper and ink ribbon, like an inkjet #printer.

*Printer Ribbons* are one long circular fabric that loops within the machine.  Sizing is specific to the machine you are using.

*Tractor Feeds* are commonly used in these devices and *use spoked wheels to pull perforated paper along the spokes* instead of friction as with other styles of printer. 

#Greenbar paper is a type of **tractor feed paper that has alternating green lines**, commonly used for printers on #mainframe systems.
