# Inkjet Printers 3.7

#Inkjet printers are also known as an *ink dispersion* #printer.  They are **quiet, inexpensive, and print high-resolution images**, perfect for a home office.  **Disadvantages include the cost of ink and image fading** over time.

These printers **drop cyan, magenta, yellow, and black (key) ink from cartridges onto a page**.  The ink is dispersed from a print head, which may be part of the printer or part of the cartridge.

### Components

*Feed Rollers* pick up the paper and move it through the printer. 

A *Duplexer* is a mechanism that enables you to **print on both sides of the paper** without human intervention.

The **ink cartridges ride on a carriage that moves back and forth across the page dispersing ink**.  If your ink cartridges do not have print heads built in, the print head will be on the #carriage.  The carriage is **pulled back and forth via a belt on a spindle**.

### Calibration

Calibrating the printer means ensuring clear lines and correct color blends.  Inkjet printers will print a #calibration page that requires human judgement to determine corrections to the calibration.  Configuring the changes to the calibration can be done in the touch menu incorporated into the screen of the printer.
