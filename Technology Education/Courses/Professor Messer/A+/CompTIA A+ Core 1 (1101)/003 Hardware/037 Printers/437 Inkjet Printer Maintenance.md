# Inkjet Maintenance 3.7

### Cleaning

**Cleaning print heads is a common maintenance** performed for inkjet printers.  Over time these print heads will become clogged with dried ink and residual buildup from printing.  **Missing color or streaking is symptomatic of clogged heads**.  Some printers have a built-in cleaning method, but usually it is done manually.  Some print heads can be removed.

### Cartridge Install

The plastic cartridges for these printers may have every color individually, or several built into one.  They are simple **plug and play devices that are easily removed and snapped back into place** while the printer calibrates them.  These cartridges are recyclable.

### Jams

Printer jams will eventually happen, **caused by misaligned paper caught in the mechanisms** of the printer.  First **remove all paper from the tray, then you can firmly pull on the stuck paper** trying not to rip it.  Once removed, check for any remaining bits in the printer and then reinsert the paper into the tray.
