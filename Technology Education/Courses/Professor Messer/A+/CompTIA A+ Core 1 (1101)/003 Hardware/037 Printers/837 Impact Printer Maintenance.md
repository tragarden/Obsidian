# Impact Printer Maintenance 3.7

*Ribbon replacement* is the **most common maintenance performed**, these ribbons usually come in a large cartridge that aligns the ribbon and houses it.  These are quickly replaced when you notice that the **ink on the paper is lightening** over time. 

*Print head replacement* is easy due to the #modular nature of the system, pull the release lever and you can remove it.  **Typically replaced at the same time as the ribbon**, these take a lot of beating from the impacting of the paper, and it gets very hot as well. 

Feeding the paper can be annoying, as the **tractor style feed needs to be perfectly aligned to prevent jams**.  Feed the paper onto the teeth of the tractor mechanism.
