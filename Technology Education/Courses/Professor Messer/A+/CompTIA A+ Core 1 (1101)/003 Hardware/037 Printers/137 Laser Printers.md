# Laser Printers 3.7

A #Laser #printer uses a combination of **powdered ink, charged ions, high voltage laser, and paper**. This results in very high-quality printing at a fast rate.  This also results in a **very complex machine with its own memory** and a mess of moving parts. 

### Components

An *Imaging Drum* is a **photosensitive drum** that may be part of your printer or incorporated into the #toner cartridge itself.  If the drum is built into your printer, it is necessary to remove and replace this part after some time.  This drum **picks up toner and transfers it to the surface of the paper**.

A #Fuser Assembly **applies heat and pressure to the paper to melt the plastic toner** and permanently fuse it to the paper.

For *color laser printers*, there are **four individual toner cartridges for cyan, yellow, magenta, and black** toner.  These four toner cartridges transfer toner to the singular transfer belt and roller.

A *Pickup Roller* is used to **retrieve one piece of paper from the printer tray**.  If multiple pieces of paper are picked up per print, then the roller needs to be cleaned or replaced.

A *Separation Pad* is used in conjunction with the pickup roller to **pick up a single sheet** of paper.  This is a small part that is easy and cheap to clean or replace.

A *Duplexing Assembly* is **used to flip paper** so that both sides can be printed on without human intervention.

### Process

1. Before you can print there is a *processing phase* where the **printer stores the page data** and prepares to print.

2. The *charging stage* is when a *corona wire* or **charging drum creates a negative charge across the entire surface of the #photosensitive imaging drum**.

3. In the *exposing face* the #laser is applied, and the **laser imparts positive charge onto the paper** wherever it strikes.

4. The *developing stage* uses the *toner drum*, which is **negatively charged to allow toner to fall onto the photosensitive drum** where it will stick to the positively charged areas. 

5. The *transferring stage* **presses the charged toner onto the paper** that is passing through the machine. 

6. The *fusing stage*, where the fusing assembly applies heat and pressure to the paper **baking the plastic toner onto the surface of the paper**.

7. The last stage is the *cleaning phase*, which occurs after printing.  This is where the **Imaging Drum is cleaned to remove any traces of toner** that were not successfully transferred to the page.
