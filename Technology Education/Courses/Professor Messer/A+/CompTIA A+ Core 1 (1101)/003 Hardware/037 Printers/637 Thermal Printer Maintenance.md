# Thermal Printer Maintenance 3.7

*Thermal Paper* is impossible to substitute with normal paper but is inexpensive.  There are many sizes, so take note of the type you have.  Replacing the spool is not much different than replacing a roll of toilet paper. **DO NOT store the paper in a warm place** or near sources of heat. 

The *heating element* can get dirty, **using isopropyl alcohol of a cleaning pen gently on the surface is effective**.  You can **use a cleaning card as well**, which can also be used to clean the pathways for the paper.

***Use pressurized air to clean the printers, NOT a vacuum*** as this would cause static electricity buildup when the debris particles leave the printer.
