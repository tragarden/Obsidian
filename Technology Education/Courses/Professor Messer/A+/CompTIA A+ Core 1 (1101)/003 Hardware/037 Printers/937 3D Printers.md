# 3D Printers 3.7

*3-D printers* take a digital rendering of a model and **use additive manufacturing to create an object layer by layer**.   This **enables fast prototyping and ability to test fit things** as they are designed.  Your design can then be sent and printed anywhere on earth, or even in space.

*Fused Deposition Modeling* ( #FDM) or *Filament Printing* **melts different filaments into a shape, building upwards** layer by layer. This is a **low waste, low difficulty method** that uses a large printing bed for many general printing projects.

#Stereolithography ( #SLA) or *Resin Printing* produces high quality prints by **hardening resin with laser or ultraviolet light**.  The **print will hang from a build platform** as the layers are added from top to bottom. 

Safety precautions are part of resin printing as it **requires protective gear for the hazardous resin**, which must be ***disposed of by at a hazardous materials disposal facility***.

The *print bed* is a **sticky surface that secures the print** as it is constructed.  In filament printing, the bed is the printing surface, and in resin printing the bed is the area where the **resin is hardened by light**.
