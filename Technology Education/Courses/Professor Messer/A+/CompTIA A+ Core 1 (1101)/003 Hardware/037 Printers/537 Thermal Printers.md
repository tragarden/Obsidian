# Thermal Printers 3.7

*Thermal printers* do not use ink or toner, but instead **use reactive paper and heat**.  These are **almost silent** as their heating element passes over the photo reactive paper.  The **paper must be kept away from light, heat, and clear tape**. 

### Components

A *feed assembly* that is turned by small gears **pulls paper through a relatively small path**. 

The *Heating Element* is a fixed head that the paper moves across.  The heating element **heats different regions of its surface to burn an image** onto the paper as it passes.

*Thermal Paper* is notably different from normal #printer paper, and a receipt from a store is a common example of this paper type.  It is **thermochromic paper covered with a chemical that changes colors when heated**.
