# Multi-Function Devices 3.6

*Multi-function Devices* ( #MFD) are usually some combination of #printer, scanner, fax, network adapter, and phone line devices.  These devices have many features and parts, meaning that a technician is often required to service them. This will likely be you.  

### Drivers and Languages

Drivers are an important aspect of these devices – you MUST get the correct #driver for your **current operating system, the exact device model you own, and the right bit-version** of the operating system.

*Printer Command Language* ( #PCL) was created by #Hewlett-Packard.  The *header of a statement* from the **printer will declare within the header whether PCL is being used**.

#PostScript was created by #Adobe Systems as a solution for **high end printing**, often in commercial applications.

Many printers can be configured with either of these languages, so make sure you’re installing the correct driver for the language your printer is configured with.

### Wireless Sharing

*Wired Device #Sharing* can be accomplished via various types of #USB or #RJ45 #ethernet cable.  Connecting the two devices via either of these options will network the devices so they can **share information and workloads**.

Wireless devices have a few modes of transmission: 

> #Bluetooth is common, although it is limited by the range of these devices. 

> 802.11 *Infrastructure Mode* allows many devices to use the same access point.

> 802.11 *Ad hoc mode* does not use an access point but creates direct links. #adhoc

*Printer Share* is when you **physically connect your printer to your computer**, and then allows devices that can communicate wirelessly with your computer to access the printer through the computer’s physical connection.

*Share Name* is the **given name of the printer** that you are accessing via Printer Share.

**Issues arise when the computer that hosts the Printer Share is turned off**, which is when you may want to install a *Print Server* to handle the jobs sent to the printer.  The **Print Server is always on and its only role is to manage incoming jobs** for the printer.

### Modes of Print

#Duplex mode enables you to **print on both sides of the paper simultaneously**, without physically flipping the paper over.

Some printers will give you the option of changing the orientation of the print between landscape and portrait.

*Printer Trays* are used to **separate different styles of paper** that might be needed for different incoming jobs.  If tray 3 has letterhead paper with your company name, this may be used for specific documents. The **administrator will set up the printer tray names and descriptions** telling you which paper is expected to be in which tray.

In the configuration settings, you can also **assign quality standards to certain types of print jobs, indicating grayscale or color-saving methods** for specific print jobs.  This is an efficient way to minimize toner and ink use, which is quite costly.

### Printer Security

You can **limit a user #permission for printing, printer management, document management**, and other special permissions.  This is useful – in the case of a library, you may only want the librarians to have access to expensive color printing, while letting all visitors have access to black and white printing.

*Printer Badging* uses an #RFID #badge to #authenticate a user and will prevent your jobs from printing until you physically present your badge to the card reader on the printer.

*Print Audit Logs* are used for cost management and #security monitoring.  It allows you to see who is sending jobs to the printer, how frequently, and the quantity of pages printed.  Some printers have this built in, while others must be managed by the print server.

*Secured prints* require a #PIN or passcode to print.

Most MFD devices use a flatbed scanner for scanning and faxing purposes.  These are sometimes accompanied by an *Automatic Document Feeder* ( #ADF) that takes documents in the queue for scanning and feeds them into the flatbed scanner after each page has completed scanning.

#Network scanning allows you to **scan a page and have it sent directly to an email inbox**, directly to a cloud service, or directly to a folder on your computer.  This is accomplished via #Microsoft *Server Message Block* ( #SMB).
