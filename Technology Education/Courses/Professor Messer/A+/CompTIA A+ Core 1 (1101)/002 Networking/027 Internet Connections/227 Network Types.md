# Network Types 2.7

*Local Area Networks* ( #LAN) usually **operate on networks with high bandwidth**, generating high connectivity in a workspace or group of buildings via #ethernet over 802.11 #wireless.

*Wide Area Network* ( #WAN) is a **huge network spanning the Earth** and is generally **much slower than LAN**s.  A WAN is used to connect LANs across the entire network. These networks can be **non-terrestrial as well as physical** connections via point-to-point serial or MPLs.

*Personal Area Network* ( #PAN) is **your own network of wireless devices** that you use daily, like *Near Field Connections* ( #NFC ), #Infrared signals, and #Bluetooth devices like headphones, smart watches, cameras, or cars.

*Metropolitan Area Network* ( #MAN) is a **network in your city with a size between LAN and WAN**. There are MAN specific topologies for the Metro #Ethernet, and these are commonly owned by local governments. 

*Storage Area Networks* ( #SAN) **connect to a centralized storage facility** with a very large capacity.  These devices are often **isolated on their own subnet and require a lot of bandwidth** as they store very large amounts of data. It operates like other storage devices you’re already familiar with and is very **efficient at reading and writing data**.

*Wireless Local Area Network* ( #WLAN) enables mobility within a large space with few limitations.  It can also be used to **expand the size of the network** using access points.
