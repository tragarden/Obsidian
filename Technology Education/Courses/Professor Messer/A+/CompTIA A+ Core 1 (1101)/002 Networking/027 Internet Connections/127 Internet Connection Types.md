# Connection Types 2.7

### Connections

#Satellite networking facilitates all **non-terrestrial communications** and has a relatively **high cost** compared to terrestrial solutions. Common speeds via satellite are **50Mbit/s download and 3 Mbit/s upload**.  It is a necessary service for remote or difficult to reach sites. 
- **High #latency is a known problem** with these systems, usually ***250ms up and down***. 
- **Rain fade** can happen when clouds pass between client and host due to high frequency signals of **2GHz colliding with the** matter in the **atmosphere**. 

#FiberOptic transmission is **very high-speed** data communication.  It **uses frequencies of light to send signals** across very great distances.  The installation cost of these systems is **more expensive than copper cable** standards, as well as being **more difficult to repair**.  It is most used for #WAN core connections for very high data rates, but over time there is more public availability to both residential homes and businesses.

#Cable #Broadband utilizes the same **copper cable** that you use to receive a cable connection to your television.  *Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification* ( #DOCSIS) sends various types of data and traffic over the cable network at high **speeds of over 1GB/s**. 

( #Asymmetric) *Digital Subscriber Line* ( #ADSL or #DSL) uses telephone lines to transmit information. It is called asymmetric due to **high download speeds and much lower upload** speeds.  **200 Mbit/s download** versus **20Mbit/s upload** is a common ratio for an asymmetric system.  These speeds are also affected by the proximity of the *Central Office* ( #CO) that is serving as the hub for data transfer.  Most devices need to be *within 10,000 feet of the CO* to work. 

#Cellular Networks support mobile phones over a #network of ‘cells’, or **regions of antenna coverage** for the system.  These devices can offer #tethering, using your device as a mobile #router.  Alternatively you can use the device as a *Mobile #Hotspot*, meaning you can **generate a 802.11 network** for other devices from your mobile phone. 

*Wireless Internet Service Provider* ( #WISP) yields **terrestrial connectivity via ground stations** that operate as powerful connection points.  These networks **eliminate the need to create network infrastructure** on someone’s property.  Often used in ***rural scenarios***, they may use a meshed 802.11 system, 5G, or a proprietary wireless protocol.  They usually **depend on a powerful outdoor #antenna**.
