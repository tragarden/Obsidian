# Network Technology 2.3

Channels are groups of frequencies that are numbered by the #IEEE.  It is **ideal to have each access point on your network operating on a different** #channel. Frequency use is regulated by most countries as well as spectrum use, power output, and interference.

#Bluetooth technology uses the *Unlicensed Industrial, Scientific, and Medica*l ( #ISM) band to communicate.  These bands do not require you to get licensing or permission from the government for use. Bluetooth operates within the Personal Area Network, usually within 10 meters of the transmitter, although industrial Bluetooth connections can maintain connections up to 100 meters.
