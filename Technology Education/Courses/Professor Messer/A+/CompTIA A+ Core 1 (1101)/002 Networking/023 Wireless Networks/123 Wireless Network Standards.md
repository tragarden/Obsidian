# Network Standards 2.3

#Wireless networking is managed by the #IEEE *LAN/MAN Standards Committee IEEE 802.1*1.  **Wi-Fi is a trademark of the Wi-Fi Alliance** who performs interoperability testing.

#### Wireless Standards

*802.11a* was released in October 1999, operating in the **5GHz range at 54 Mbit/s,** which was very fast for the time.  It was able to operate on other frequencies after the proper licensing. These devices and their networks are ***not really in use*** anymore. 

The *2.4GHz 802.11b* network **operates at a lower frequency**, meaning that the signal will ***bounce around objects instead of being absorbed***, as the 5GHz signals do.

*802.11b* was released in October 1999 and operates in the **2.4GHz range at 11 Mbit/s**. This network has ***greater range as the signal isn’t absorbed by objects*** in the environment.  A disadvantage to this frequency range is that other devices, such as baby monitors, house phones, and #Bluetooth devices operate in this range as well.

*802.11g* was an upgrade to previous standards, available in June 2003. It operated on the **2.5GHz range at 54 Mbit/s** and is ***backward compatible with older standards.***  This means that you can still use your older 802.11b devices on this network.

*802.11n* ( #Wi-Fi 4) was an update to all previous standards available in October 2009.  During this generation, these networks were ***no longer being referred to as 802.11 networks, but rather Wi-Fi X.0 networks.*** This standard was developed to **operate on both 2.4GHz and 5GHz frequencies with 40 MHz channel widths.** When utilizing the 40MHz mode and 4 antennas, you can achieve a **potential 600 Mbit/s.** This is possible via the *Multiple-input Multiple-output* ( #MIMO) system, which allows the **simultaneous use of multiple transmitting and receiving antennas.**

*802.11ac* (**Wi-Fi 5**) was released in January 2014 offering significant improvements over the previous standard.  Operating on the **5GHz frequency, it offered up to 160MHz channel bandwidth,** increasing #channel bonding and denser signal modulation for faster data transfer.  It has **8 downlink streams that were not only MIMO, but also Multi-user** #MU-MIMO – meaning that each input/output channel allowed for multiple channels for each user. This is** twice as many as the previous generation, allowing for nearly 7 Gbit/s transmission** speeds.  Some access points associated with these networks claim to operate on both the 5GHz and 2.4GHz frequencies, and if so, this means that the access point is using Wi-Fi 4 to access the 2.4GHz frequency.

*802.11ax* (**Wi-Fi 6**) was approved in February 2021 operating at both **2.4GHz and 5GHz frequencies with 20, 40, 80, and 160MHz channel widths.**  It is capable of **1,201 Mbit/s per channel via 8 bi-directional MU-MIMO** streams.  This standard was designed to address common issues associated with too many uses in a small area. *Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access* ( #OFDMA) which operates similar to cellular communications and enabled many users to efficiently access the network in a concentrated area.

Long-range fixed wireless addresses the limited distance of s**tock antennas**, which only **have a range of about 40-50 meters.**  These systems can link two buildings across great distances using fixed directional antennas, establishing a focused, **point to point connection.** These networks can be complex, and you ***must follow all regulations and get the required licensure.*** They may use 2.4GHz or 5GHz frequencies, or you and be licensed to use other frequencies by your local municipality.  The power of these devices ***can be dangerous*** and should be installed by professionals. The ***antenna must be protected from lightning strikes***, and it must be ***secured away from any power source***, so the signal is not distorted.

*Radio Frequency Identification* ( #RFID) is used in many applications, for things like access *badges, assembly line auditing, pet identification, and anything that needs to be tracked.*  It uses radar technology transmitted to the tag.  Radio frequencies power the tag by a transmitter, and the tag responds with an ID signal in bidirectional communication.
