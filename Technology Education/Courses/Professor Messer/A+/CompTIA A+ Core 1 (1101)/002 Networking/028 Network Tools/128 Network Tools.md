#### Tools

##### Physical Tools

*Cable Crimpers* are used to **crimp, or pinch, a cable to apply a connector** to the end of the wire. The metal **prongs in the tool push through the wire insulation and directly into the copper** within.  The plug end is permanently pressed into the cable end.

*Wire Stripper* and *Cable Snips* will be used in conjunction with the crimpers in many cases.  The **stripper removes insulation** from wires, and the **scissors can cut through insulation** and copper.

##### Digital Tools

*Wi-Fi Analyzers* enable you to monitor your wireless network, identifying errors and the signal strength of antennas.  These may be purpose-built hardware, or software applications that specialize in 802.11 analysis.  These will allow you to see signal strength of an antenna in real time as you move it, giving you the ability to determine the best location for the antenna.

*Tone Generator* or *Toner Probe* is used to **locate wires or find breaks in a system**.  It uses an **inductive probe to detect wiring without making physical contact** and when wiring is located, a tone is emitted from the device.  The device is attached to the source wire via alligator clips or other attachment method, which will then enable you to begin wire tracing.  When the probe is near the wire, it can detect its own current frequency running through the wire showing you where the designated wire is but not others.

#### Punch Down System

A *Punch Down Tool* ‘punches’ a wire into a wiring block, such as a **66 block or 110 block**.  This tool **will hold the wire** you’re working with, feed it into the punch block, then **punch the cable while trimming the excess** wire.  This is an efficient but tedious process to secure all the wiring. 

- **Organization** is vital to using a punch block – cable management is key to success.

- **Maintaining proper twists** in the Category #6A cable used is a good practice.

- **Document** as much as you can by writing, tagging, and even putting graffiti on hardware.

*Cable Testers* perform **continuity tests and wire mapping** and can additionally be used to **identify missing pins or crossed wires**.  It is NOT used for frequency testing, crosstalk or signal loss locating.

*Loopback Plugs* are **redundant devices that feed into themselves**, allowing you to **test ports for connectivity issues and damage** by connecting a device to itself.  This works for #Serial, #RS-232, #ethernet, #fiber, #T1, and more.

*Physical Taps* are used to **disconnect a link and insert a tap** into the middle, which may be an active or passive tap.  These are used to **intercept network traffic and then send a copy of the data to a packet capture device**. 

*Port Mirrors* are used to **redirect #port traffic** and are often built directly into a switch, known as a *switched port analyzer*.  This is a software-based tap with limited functionality, but they will allow you to send data to an analyzer.
