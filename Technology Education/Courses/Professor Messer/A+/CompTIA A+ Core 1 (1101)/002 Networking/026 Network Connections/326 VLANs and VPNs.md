# VLAN and VPN 2.6

### VLAN

A *Virtual Local Area Network* ( #VLAN) is a **subdivision of a larger network that is created logically within a piece of hardware**, instead of relying on a literal physical division using #hardware.  If there were 20 ports on a switch, this might mean taking ports 1-10 and assigning them to VLAN A, and assigning ports 11-20 to VLAN B.

*Local Area Networks* ( #LAN) are a **group of devices found within the same #broadcast #domain**.

### VPN

*Virtual Private Networks* ( #VPN) automatically #encrypt data on a public #network so that if your data were to be intercepted, that party would be unable to understand the data being sent as the **message will be obscured by encryption**.

The VPN will pass from our own network to the *VPN #Concentrator*, which is an encryption/decryption access device that is often built into the #firewall.  VPNs come in several formats, including both hardware and software.  Occasionally you will find a VPN built directly into your OS.  The data is sent from your client through an ‘encryption tunnel’ on its way to the VPN Concentrator, which decrypts the data and forwards it to the appropriate server.
