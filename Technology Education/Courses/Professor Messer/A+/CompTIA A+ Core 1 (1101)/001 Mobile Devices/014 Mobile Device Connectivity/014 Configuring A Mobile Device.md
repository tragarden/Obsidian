# Configuring Mobile Devices 1.4

Most phone settings come preconfigured, meaning that you’re texting and calling should be enabled.  E-mail is an example of something that must be set up by the user as configurations and platforms vary.

#### Synchronization 

*Data Synchronization* is based on the rate of data and **allows for backup and recovery of data** should the device storing it become inoperable.

*Google Workspace* and #iCloud are competing services that offer the same or similar services for their respective user-base. iCloud offers an extensive list of synchronization choices, giving you full customization of what you chose to share between devices.

#Microsoft 365 is a cloud-based service that stores the data from these applications and makes them available to authorized users.  Outlook.com is browser-based access to the cloud.  365 enables synchronization of mail, contacts, calendars, reminders, and notes of users.
#### E-mail

Microsoft’s #Outlook and Exchange are some of the most popular interfaces for email.  Exchange can only be used if you have your own server to host the interactions and data stored within Exchange. 

#### Use Cost and Limits

*Data Cap*s and *Transfer Costs* can be mitigated by setting devices to only transmit large amounts of data over 802.11 connections so that you don’t use too much cellular data, which can be costly.
