# Cellular Standards 1.4

Mobile devices are called ‘cell’ phones because the towers that transmit the signals operate in zones or within a certain size radius referred to as cells.

#### GSM and 2G

The original networks were #2G networks broadcasting over specific frequencies.  There was the *Global System for Mobile Communications* (GSM) and the *Code Division Multiple Access* (CDMA).   These offered *poor data support* and originally used *circuit-switching*.  This means that they were **great for voice** communications, but *bad for sending data*. 

#GSM networks accounted for 90% of the market and became standard for the European Union and international coverage.  This was used by AT&T and T-Mobile in the United States via #SIM Cards, also known as the *Subscriber Identity Module card*.  SIM cards saved user preferences and connected them to your phone number.

*GSM* standards used #multiplexing, which means that **all the users shared the available space on a network**.  If too many users want to access the network at the same time, the network cannot support the full population of users within it and depends on user downtime. 

#### CDMA and 3G 

#CDMA allows everyone to communicate at the same time, creating a unique code for each call which can be used by the receiving side to filter incoming calls. These networks were used by Verizon and Sprint, which allowed for handset control by the network provider.  These networks were not widely adopted outside of the United States. 

*3G* (3rd Generation) was introduced in 1998 and upgraded the connectivity of 2G, meaning improved speeds and up to **several megabits per second** of data transmission.  Improvements in bandwidth meant that GPS and streaming video was now possible. 

#### 4G and LTE

*4G* introduced Long Term Evolution (LTE) technology which converged the older standards of GSM and CDMA.  It is based on GSM and “Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution” ( #EDGE) which allowed for download rates of 150 Mbit/s.  Later, #LTE Advanced (LTE-A) would allow for 300 Mbit/s transmissions. 

#### 5G 

*5G* launched in 2020 and offers further significant improvements to performance. It transmits at higher frequencies than previous generations. Current speeds are around 100-900 Mbit/s and will eventually be able to **transmit 10 gigabits per second**. 

An additional benefit to 5G is that it allows for **more data transmission from a single device**, which enables IoT devices like Wi-Fi lightbulbs the capability to perform more actions more often.  **Faster monitoring, notifications, cloud processing, and larger file transmission** are all notable improvements. 

#### Preferred Roaming

*Preferred Roaming List* ( #PRL) is on CDMA networks and allows your phone to connect to the best signal per your location.  This information is updated ‘*Over the Air*’ ( #OTA) and is an active scan to locate the most stable signal.
