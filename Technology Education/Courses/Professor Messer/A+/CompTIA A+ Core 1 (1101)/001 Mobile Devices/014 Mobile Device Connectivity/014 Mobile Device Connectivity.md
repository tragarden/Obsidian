# Mobile Device Connectivity 1.4

#### Bluetooth

#Bluetooth pairing offers built in security via security PIN.  Pairing is usually a one-time event, establishing a relationship between the two devices allowing for automatic connections in the future.  Sometimes pairing isn’t straightforward, and you will need to consult the user manual or the manufacturer literature to determine the button sequence to enable pairing. 

The expected procedure for pairing means *enabling Bluetooth on both devices and then setting the target device to ‘discoverable’ mode*.  Several devices may populate the ‘Nearby Devices’ list when you are searching for a device.   A code or PIN will be provided to make sure you are connecting to the device you are actively using instead of something in your neighbor’s house.

#### GPS

*Global Positioning System* ( #GPS) is a system **created by the US Department of Defense** which uses a **network of 30 satellites** to determine location on Earth.  Precise navigation is achieved when the device can *connect to at least 4 of the satellites for triangulating* accurate locations. **Longitude, latitude, and altitude are determined by timing differences** in signal received by the positioning satellites.

#Geotracking and device location services determine your physical location based on GPS, Wi-Fi, and cellular data. 

#### MDM

*Mobile Device Management* ( MDM) focuses on monitoring and authorizing company-owned and user-owned devices that access the company networks. 

#MDM solutions allow you to manage many devices on a network at once.  It **allows an administrator to access the permissions and configurations of all the relevant devices** within a network.  They may have control over the entire device or a partitioned part limiting access to company data only.  Examples of this are forcing screen locks and PINs for access.

MDM can also be used to **configure company e-mails** so that the user doesn’t have to do anything.  It can also **enforce the use of two-factor authentication and biometrics**.  Furthermore, you have control over what apps are installed and the #blacklist / #whitelist for applications. 

#### BYOD

*Bring Your Own Device* ( #BYOD) is a term used to describe employees that use their personal home devices for work purposes.
