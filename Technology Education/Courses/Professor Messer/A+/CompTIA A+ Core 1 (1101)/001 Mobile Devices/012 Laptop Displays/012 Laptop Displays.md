# Laptop Displays - 1.2 

#### Displays

*Liquid Crystal *#Display (LCD) features an **array of crystals** in front of a **backlight** that shines through them, a color filter, polarizing filter, and the surface of the display.  They are **lightweight, low power, and inexpensive**.  The most notable ***disadvantage is that black is hard to depict*** due to the brightness of the backlight, and the backlight is difficult to replace. 

#### Display Types

*Twisted Nematic* (TN) #LCD uses the original technology, but with **faster response times** at the expense of ***poorer viewing angle*** that inverts colors at certain angles.

*Vertical Alignment* (VA) LCD is the middle option between the **fast responses** of the TN style and the **accurate color representation** of the IPS units.

*In Plane Switching* (IPS) LCD has **exceptional color representation** at the cost of *more expensive* production compared to TN units. 

*Organic Light Emitting Diode* (OLED) uses an organic material that emits light when exposed to an electric current. These units are **thinner, lighter,** and glass is not a necessary component.  They are useful for phones and have **very accurate color representation** at the cost of higher production costs.

#Antennas are incorporated into the screen due to the screen being the highest point of the machine.  This can make some repairs harder, and the antenna must be considered when unplugging peripherals from the interior of the laptop. 

#Webcams and #microphones are usually included in the screen as well, typically found in the top center of the screen.

*Cold Cathode Fluorescent Lamp* (CCFL) is an older style of backlight* requiring higher voltage* and power for operation.  They added *significant thickness* to displays.  These units depended on power inverters, as they used A/C power, where laptops use D/C power.  Sometimes if a display is not working, a light can be shined upon the surface of the display.  If you can see the computer generating images, then the inverter is likely the part that failed.

*Light-Emitting Diode* (LED) backlights are thinner and lighter, consume less power, and are more modern style.  They have a matrix of LED adorned strips behind the liquid crystals.

#Digitizer is sometimes a feature in screens, where you can use a pen or some sort of touch to submit information to the computer via the screen surface.  These eliminate the need for a physical keyboard.
