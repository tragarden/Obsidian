# Laptop Hardware 1.1

#### Batteries

**Lithium-Ion** or **Lithium-Polymer** batteries are designed to have no ‘memory effect’.  Every time a #battery is discharged, it loses a small amount of its total charging capacity.  Laptop batteries are often proprietary in design, and at a minimum *require specific amps, voltage, and contacts* for safe usage.  Modular batteries are easily replaced, while some laptops feature an internal battery that is not.


#### Keyboards

#Keyboards are connected to the laptop using a **ribbon cable** and are easily replaced. Not all laptop keyboards have a numeric keypad.  Many keys come with a secondary function -such as brightness adjustment- operated by control or a function key. 

Key caps on a laptop keyboard might be fragile, so follow the instructions from the manufacturer exactly to prevent damaging small internal parts.


#### Random Access Memory (RAM)

**Small Outline Dual In-Line Memory Module (SO-DIMM)** is a  #RAM form factor that is commonly used in laptops.  This is usually modular and easily removed.  If a manufacturer does not use SO-DIMM, then it is likely that the RAM is soldiered to the motherboard of the laptop and cannot be modified or easily replaced.  Usually, the entire motherboard must be replaced.

#### Storage

Laptop #storage uses a form factor of **2.5” SATA**, smaller than the standard **3.5” SATA** we use in desktops.  Older laptops will use **Magnetic Disk drives** with mechanical parts, where new units will use **Solid State Drives** to afford more storage space and faster transmission of data.  **M.2 drives** are also common due to their smaller form factor, ease of installation via single screw, and no need for SATA or power cables.

When installing new storage hardware, reinstallation must be considered.  There are several methods.   You can install a fresh Operating System onto the new drive, then install all preferred apps and files for the user.  You can also clone the current OS for the user, also known as creating an image of the OS.  This required image creation software.  There are commercial and open-source solutions available, and clones can be used to create the same image on multiple computers. 

Drive-to-Drive transfer requires either multiple machines or multiple drives – as the data is actively moved between two operational drives.

#### Network

Wireless modules are found in two form factors: **Mini PCI** or **Mini PCI Express**.  They can have **LAN, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth**, and other connection protocols to connect to networks or devices.  These devices are modular and easily replaced. 

A **Personal Area Network (PAN)** describes the personal devices of a user and their relationships, such as Bluetooth headphones that interact with both your phone and PC.

**Wireless Wide-Area Network (WWAN)** describes a cellular network we use for phones.

**Biometrics** depends on hardware to collect the biometric data, and then software to interpret the data from the hardware and actively use it on the user’s device to authenticate and verify users.

**Near-Field Communication (NFC)** allows for fast data transfer or authentication to very-nearby devices that are within 4cm of the transmitter.
