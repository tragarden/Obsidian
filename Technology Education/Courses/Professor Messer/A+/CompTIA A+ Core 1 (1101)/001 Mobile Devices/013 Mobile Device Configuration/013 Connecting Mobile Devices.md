# Connecting Mobile Devices 1.3

#### Devices

Phones, tablets, and other peripheral devices have many modes of connectivity.  They can be used for connectivity, backup, identification, synchronization, and authentication. 

#### Physical Connection Types

*Universal Serial Bus* ( #USB) is the standard for high-speed physical connections. They come in a few types: A, Micro B, Mini B, and C. 

#USB-C is a 24-pin double-sided symmetric USB connector for both hosts and devices.  It acts as a USB 2.0/3.0/4.0 connector, and can transmit other signals such as DisplayPort, HDMI, and Thunderbolt. 

#Lightning is #Apple proprietary 8-pin cable used for the iPhone and iPad.  Advantages include higher power output and symmetrical insertion.  A simpler design (should) lower production cost as well.

The variety of cables means that as a technician, you will need to familiarize yourself with all these types and likely carry them with you. 

#DB-9 (aka DE-9) cables are a recognizable older technology that we used for serial communications before the standard USB.  They are commonly used with #RS-232 signals and have been an industry standard since 1969.  Most modern devices will not have this type of connection.

#### Wireless Connection Types

Near Field Communication ( #NFC) allows you to send a small amount of data wirelessly based on proximity.  These are convenient for register transactions, ticket validation, transportation, information exchange, and identification for access.

#Bluetooth offers fast communications over short distances, commonly connecting mobile devices and their peripherals. 

Cell phones can be used as a wireless #hotspot, allowing other devices to utilize the #5G signal from the cell network to access the internet via standard 802.11 channels.  This lets your phone serve as a portable router.
