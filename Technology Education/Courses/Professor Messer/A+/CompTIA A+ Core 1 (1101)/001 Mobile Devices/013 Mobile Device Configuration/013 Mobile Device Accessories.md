#### Styluses

*Capacitive styluses* or pens are used to emulate the touch of a human finger on a touch screen device.  This is a physical device and does not have connectivity with your devices, meaning that they can be used with any sort of touch screen.

An **active or digital** stylus connects and syncs with your devices, sometimes allowing you to use the stylus without touching the screen of the device.  They can have programmable buttons and pressure sensitivity.  These are more expensive and complex than capacitive stylus and tend to have compatibility limitations.

#### Pads

*Drawing pads* use a #digitizer to communicate with an active stylus for very precise input that is removed from the screen of the device into a pad that is more durable.

*Trackpads* are often found on retail laptops and offer an integrated way to use a mouse.  There are external examples that use batteries and Bluetooth to communicate with your device.

#### Audio

Hands-free audio can have many connection styles, including USB, analog audio jacks, #lightning port, or 3.5mm *Tip-ring-ring-sleeve* ( #TRRS) connectors.

#### Laptop Accessories

*Laptop Docking Stations* receive your laptop at a specific workstation and allow you to use the device more like a standard desktop PC.  It saves you a lot of time by negating the need to remove and reattach cables for peripherals and networking each time you enter or leave the workstation.  Some of these docking stations allow for the addition of more processing power, memory, or RAM.

*Port Replicators* are similar in concept to docking stations, typically connecting via USB, smaller and cheaper, and without the option of expansion cards.
