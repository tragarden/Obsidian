# Troubleshooting Video 5.4

### Diagnosis

#### Black Screen

If you do not have a video image displayed on your monitor, the first step every time is to **make sure that power and signal cables are correctly plugged in**.  Next, check to make sure you are **using the correct video input**.  There is a chance that your ***brightness settings*** were set to a dark setting, so check those as well. If these options fail change out the #display. If #Windows loads but goes black after, ***press (F8) to toggle #VGA mode*** to render Windows in a lower resolution for further troubleshooting.

#### Poor Quality and Native Resolution

If your images are *poor quality*, **check the pins on the connectors** for your cables.  Sometimes a pin will break off and cause imaging issues. **Check the refresh rate and resolution settings** in your #OS and make sure they match the specifications set by the manufacturer of the display.  *Hardware acceleration* can also cause problems with software drivers leading to poor image quality.

The *Native Resolution* of a display is related to the number of pixels contained within the monitor.  You want the **resolution configured for your computer to match the native resolution of your display**, and mismatching resolution causes a distorted and warped image.  As long as your configured resolution is a multiple of the native resolution, your image should not be distorted as the ratio of length and width should be correct.

#### Screen Damage

*Burn-in* is a problem that ***occurs on any type of monitor*** when an image is displayed for such a long time that the ***pixels permanently change***. #Pixel-shifting is when the computer makes **minor changes to the position of the pixels** that are barely able to be seen by the human eye.  This shuffles the pixels a bit and deters burn-in.

#LCD screens **use ‘image sticking’ to flash a white screen for a moment in order to clear the images from the pixels** to counter burn-in.

*Dead pixels* are black and **usually a manufacturing issue**.  There is ***no solution*** for this.  Sometimes it’s just dirt on the screen that can be wiped off.

*Flashing or flickerin*g of the screen is often easily remedied by **securing cable connection**s.  Check the display settings for your operating system and make sure nothing conflicts.

#### Configuration Issues

*Incorrect colors* appear as a colored filter that appears across the entire image displayed on your monitor.  **Check your monitor settings** for tint, custom colors, and if you cannot make adjustments to correct this problem, **perform a factory reset** on your display.  **Check your drivers and ‘night light’ settings**.

For a *dim image*, check your **brightness and contrast settings** first.  Your OS may have **settings like battery-saver and auto-dimming** that are activated without your awareness.  #Driver settings can also affect the dimming of images.  If there is hardware failure, this means that the #backlight or entire unit needs to be replaced.

#### Audio Issues

You may experience **audio problems if your computer has built-in speakers**.  If there is no sound, **check for volume buttons, a mute button, or audio jacks** on the monitor.  Determine the type of connection, and then troubleshoot for that specific connector type – in this case you need to check what #audio input you have configured for your operating system.  There are #analog and #digital inputs on a monitor and sometimes audio is integrated directly into the #video signal.

#### Projectors

We commonly refer to large screen projection machines as *LCD Projectors*.  These utilize a **metal-halide lamp that is powerfully bright and very hot** – always allow the bulbs to cool and keep the device plugged in as the fan will run after you have shut it off. 

If your LCD projector is *not emitting light* or image, this **may be a cooling issue**.  #Overheating causes the system to throttle and stop projecting, check out the airflow of the device and clean out dust from its air filters.
