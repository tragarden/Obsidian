# Troubleshooting Mobile Devices 5.5

### Batteries

#Battery *health deterioration* is expected in all devices that discharge and recharge on a regular basis.  If your battery is **draining quickly, check your reception** as your phone will continue to attempt to establish a signal.  **Disable extraneous networks** such as 802.11, #Bluetooth, and #GPS to prolong battery life.  You can check to see if applications are heavily taxing your phone via Settings/Battery on both #iOS and #android.

*Swollen batteries* occur when a **chemical reaction releases toxic gases** that are contained within the self-containing battery packet.  Stop use of these batteries immediately as they are a **major fire and chemical hazard**.  Dispose of them in the appropriate way.

*Broken screens* are a common way devices are damaged.  This is not an easy fix, and your easiest bet is to **back up the device and replace it**.  If the #display is shattered, cover the cracks with clear tape while you’re backing up the device.  Often it is not just the screen glass that is broken, but often the #digitizer as well.

*Charging failure* can occur when the charging port on the device or the charging cable are broken.  Carefully **clear dust away from the port** and throw away cables that are damaged, kinked, or frayed.  The cable can be **checked with a multimeter to ensure that the proper voltage is being supplied**.

### Poor Connection

#Cellular and #Wi-Fi can both be susceptible to *poor connectivity*, this is usually related to the location of the device receiving the signal.  **Physical objects can impede signals**.  Sometimes two competing signals interfere with each other, in this case try switching the frequency that your device is transmitting over.

### Liquids

*Damage from liquids* is not covered by manufacturer warranties and they use *Liquid Contact Indicators* ( #LCI) to determine when water has affected the #hardware of a device.  ***If you get your device wet, immediately power it off and DO NOT turn it back on or plug it in***. **Remove any parts that are able to be removed**.  Rice is actually NOT an effective method for drying your phone, you should **use a desiccant like silica gel packs** to absorb the liquid if you have access to them.  Mainly do not use or interact with your device until you are confident that the liquid has fully dried. ***Don’t even move it around for the first 24 hours***. 

### Overheating

#Overheating is a common issue as well – they create their own heat and can easily be left in **direct sunlight or on hot surfaces**.  Apps that **consume a lot of processing power** will heat up your device as the battery discharges at a faster rate.   Luckily **most devices have thermostats** to determine when to power the phone off in case of overheating.

### Physical Damage

Sometimes *ports are physically damaged* on a device, and unfortunately there is little that can be done in most cases as the ports are soldiered onto the system board of the phone **requiring special tools and knowledge to perform this repair**.  Sometimes you can bend a pin back into place, but in most cases, you will have to replace the entire system board if a port becomes damaged. 

### Malware

All devices are susceptible to #malware, so make sure to regularly **use a security app or virus scanner**.  Symptoms of malware include **overheating, pop-ups, unfamiliar apps, excessive data use, and high #CPU usage**. 

### Hardware Failure

*Cursor Drift* is an issue on older devices where the **cursor no longer follows our finger or may move on its own.** Usually this **requires manual calibration via touching the screen** in specific locations.

If your #digitizer is not displaying any image or will not respond to touch feedback, usually **restarting the device or removing the battery** will perform a hard reset and reset the digitizer.
