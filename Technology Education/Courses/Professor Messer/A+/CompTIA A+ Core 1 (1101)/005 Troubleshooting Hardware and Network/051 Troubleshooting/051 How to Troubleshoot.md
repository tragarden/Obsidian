# How to Troubleshoot 5.1

### Change Control

*Change control* is part of change management where **data is backed up chronologically allowing you to revert development** to previous stages.

### Basic Procedure

1. The first step in troubleshooting is to **gather as much information** on the problem as possible.  Gather information **from as many sources as possible, including users** and who has access to the hardware.  Once you **identify symptoms or changes that caused the issue, treat them individually** with their own solution methodology.  **Look for access history via log files**, some applications may even have helpful log information.  **Backup as much data as possible and do a rollback** to a different system state.  Make sure all the users are aware of any changes that have occurred or future changes you make when you revert the system to previous states.

2. Next you need to **establish a theory** for whatever problem you are experiencing.  Consider and **list as many things as you can**, making a large list of all possible causes.  ***Sort these theories from easiest to solve, to most difficult***.  ***Apply Occam’s Razor to all causes*** and determine which is the most likely.  Once you have your priority queue, begin researching symptoms and their solutions.

3. After generating a list of theories, **begin testing these ideas and determine whether you can solve the problem**.  If you try to no avail, contact a professional when you have exhausted all your theories. 

4. Next you will need to **create a plan of action** that can solve the problem **with minimal impact to the system**.  **Identify potential problems and side effects** that might happen because of your plan.  Refer to literature from the manufacturer and official forums to properly address the situation.

5. **Deploy your plan and escalate to an authority figure** if something goes wrong.

6. **Verify that your plan has been successfully implemented** and that no issues or side effects are happening after your fix.  **This is the stage where preventative measures should be implemented** to avoid future issues.

7. Finally, **document all observations and changes** to the system.  **Describe the actions taken** and what the problem was.  **Detail the outcome and submit this to a formal database** if available.
