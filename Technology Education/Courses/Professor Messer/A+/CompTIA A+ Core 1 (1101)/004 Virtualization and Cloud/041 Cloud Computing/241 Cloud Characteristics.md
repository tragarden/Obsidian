# Cloud Characteristics 4.1

### Types of Cloud Services

*Internal cloud* is when **you own all your own hardware and the data center it is kept within**.  Once it is built, you will only have the cost of maintenance and electricity.

*External cloud* is **shared hardware that is owned by a third party**. You will pay a recurring bill and will not have access to any hardware.

*Metered cloud* services let you **pay for what you use**.  Whenever you access the cloud, you will be billed versus paying a flat monthly fee when you may not need the service for an extended period.

*Desktop as a Service* ( #DaaS) is when you **remotely operate another computer** over the internet.  This is often facilitated by a server, using *Virtual Desktop Infrastructure* ( #VDI) and a set of #peripheral devices.

### Advantages

*Benefits* of cloud computing include **rapid elasticity**, meaning that you can grow or shrink the size of your project instantaneously to all users.  You can take advantage of more or less hardware easily.

**High availability** means that the systems used to run the cloud are **highly redundant**.  All the technologies are backed up in multiple ways, so if hardware was to fail then the backup takes over immediately, preventing the systems from going down.  **Files are backed up too**, allowing files to be published to multiple cloud sites.
