# Cloud Models 4.1

### Cloud Computing

*Cloud computing* can be thought of as **having all your hardware remotely accessible and off-site**.  It allows all your data and hardware immediately to be accessed by anyone in your group nearly anywhere on earth.  It enables you to **deploy infrastructure in a few minutes**.  You don’t need to house or maintain your own technology; you only need to pay your bill and you will have access to cloud technology.

If you have your own *virtualized data center*, then you are on a *private cloud network*; otherwise, you are likely using a public cloud such as #AWS or #google.  There are **hybrid situations that use both private and public clouds, as well as community clouds** where several groups share their access to the cloud.

*Infrastructure as a Service* ( #IaaS) or *Hardware as a Service* ( #HaaS) is the process of **outsourcing your own equipment for others to use**.  You will have to maintain all the hardware, and all **your data will be exposed to some extent**.  A common use for Haas is when someone needs a webserver.

*Software as a Service* ( #SaaS) enables users to directly **access software on-demand without installation**.  You will not have access to the data center or control over your data.  #Gmail and #Microsoft 365 are good examples of SaaS products. 

*Platform as a Service* ( #PaaS) is when the hardware and maintenance for a platform is performed by someone else, but you are managing all development within that operating system.  You will not have control over your data or access to a data center.  You will be able to develop an app or website from what is made available to the platform – salesforce.com and squarespace.com are examples of PaaS products.
