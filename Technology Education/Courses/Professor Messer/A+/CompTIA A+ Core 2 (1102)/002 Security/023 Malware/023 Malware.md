# Malware 2.3

### Malware

#Malware is a general term used to describe any **malicious software that is inserted into your network or devices without your consent** and usually without your knowledge.  There are many examples of this malicious software, some collect keystrokes, some enable remote access or control over your client, some force advertisements, and viruses and worms can encrypt your data or uncover confidential data from your system.  Viruses and worms can even spread from your device or #network to other devices and networks.

#### Vulnerabilities

**Authors of malware study common vulnerabilities and then design an executable file or remote access backdoor that exploits these known weaknesses.**  This may install a file that runs programs, but it could also yield access to an attacker who may then install bots and data accumulators onto your device or network. 

#### Updating

**Updating your systems and hardware regularly is important in defending against these exploits.**  Without updating, you may be allowing a #vulnerability to remain that is easily exploited.

If you are updated, then **operator error is likely the next suspected weak link** in the chain.  Perhaps you clicked a nefarious #email link or a #pop-up or convinced that you need to download something malicious or infiltrated by a worm on another local device.

### Attack Types

#### Trojan Horse

*Trojan Horse* attacks uses links that **appear appealing to the user to convince them to download a malicious file or program** onto the computer.  It is **malware disguised as something useful** and usually free.  A good #anti-virus scanner will likely detect them, but unchecked they are able to assert control over your system and even install other #applications for more damage.

#### Rootkit

A #Rootkit is originally a #Unix technique that was adapted for malicious intent for later operating systems.  Rootkits **modify your core system files to incorporate themselves as part of the #kernel your #OS is based on.** This makes it invisible to most management tools as it will be viewed as higher in the hierarchy than the authority of the management tools. It is **often invisible to traditional anti-viral software as well.**

##### Rootkit Removal

Removing a #rootkit is not as straightforward as other malware removals because it is so deeply implanted into your system that extensive work must be done to remove it.  You can detect them using some #anti-malware programs, but most **likely you will need to look at your system activity to determine if something is amiss. Due to the intensity of the removal, you will need to identify the rootkit and seek out a specific removal software for that rootkit.**  Luckily these are less common with the advent of modern #UEFI Secure Boot technology.

#### Virus

A #Virus is malware that **reproduces itself within a file system or #network of devices.** Running an infected application can spread the virus, and while some are not easily detected, others will cause **notable disruptions to your system and hardware performance.**  Anti-viral apps are very common, and you should be checking to make sure their signature file is regularly updated.

##### Boot Sector Virus

*Boot Sector Viruses* do not run after boot like most applications – they will **run before the #OS is initialized which will protect it from being disabled** by anti-virus applications.  Even if you remove it, it **will reinstall itself with every #boot** and cause the same issues.  Luckily these are rare with the advent of modern #UEFI #BIOS technology.

### Spyware

#Spyware **observes what you do on your devices** and uses that information for browser monitoring, **keylogging, identity theft, affiliate fraud, and to force advertisements** into your system.  Usually these come in the form of a trojan horse attack.

#### Keyloggers

#Keyloggers **collect keystrokes, login URLs, emails, screenshots, clipboard data, messages, screen captures, mouse location information,** and many other metrics of user input.  Even if you use a #VPN or other methods of #encryption, the keylogger will bypass the encryption by reading the data right there on your machine.

#### Ransomware

#Ransomware is when someone **steals your data and encrypts it,** making it inaccessible to you.  This could be your entire set of drives, rendering your device inoperable and your data in the hands of an attacker. Usually, these attackers **demand payment in the form of cryptocurrencies** as they are untraceable.

#### Cryptominers

A #Cryptominer gets installed into your device or network and then utilizes the #hardware on your devices to **solve difficult math problems to earn currency.**  Mining is very hardware intensive, so people will steal some of your performance to extract more money for themselves.  This will appear as #CPU usage spikes when visiting websites, although this could be caused by other forms of malware as well.
