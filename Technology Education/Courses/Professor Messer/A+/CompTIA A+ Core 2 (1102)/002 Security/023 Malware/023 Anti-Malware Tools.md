# Anti-Malware Tools 2.3

### Recovery Tools

*Windows Recovery Environment* ( #WRE) is a ***very powerful and subsequently very dangerous tool*** that is a last resort utility for removing malware. WRE gives you **full control over operating system files and folders, device #startup priorities, Master Boot Records (#MBR), and file system repair tools.** From here, IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING, you can remove the #malware and repair your #boot sector.

#### Methods for Use

This is available by **holding in the Shift key while clicking the Restart button** on your start menu within any version of #Windows.  Alternatively, you can do this from **bootable media.**

*Windows 10* pathing:      **Settings > Update and Security > Recovery > Advanced Startup**

*Windows 11* pathing:      **System > Recovery > Advanced Startup > Restart Now**

To start the #console on Windows, after rebooting go to   

**Troubleshoot > Advanced Options > Command Prompt**

### Defensive Applications

#### Anti-Malware

You need to have both *Anti-Malware* and *Anti-Virus* #software on your devices, and preferably ones that act in real-time to analyze system threats.  A lot of modern applications do not require signature sets for detection; they can recognize malicious activities as well.

#### Firewall

A Software-based #Firewall observe network traffic to *identify and prevent malicious communications.* At a bare minimum you should be using *Windows Defender Firewall.*  These run constantly and monitor all communications on the network. 

### Training

#### Phishing

*Anti-Phishing Training* is required to counter **exploitation of human gullibility.** You must educate your team so that they do not willingly give away private information through *social engineering.*  You can create false #phishing emails to test your users and see if they will fall for this style of attack.

#### User Education

*End User Education* is important to **fortify your defenses via one-on-one training,* posters and signage, community boards, messages at login, and pages that pop up** when certain apps or sites are used.

### Clean Install

***Reinstalling your #OS is the only way to ensure that malware has been removed from the device.*** A complete wipe is the best option, paired with an image of the system from a network share.  If this is not an option, you can choose to **restore from the last good backup you have that is NOT infected.** Manual installation and recovery of files is possible, but very time-consuming and should be a last resort.
