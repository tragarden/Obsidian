# Physical Security for Staff 2.1

### Physical Security Components

#### Key Fobs

*Key Fobs* are an **alternative to key cards and physical keys.** They contain an #RFID chip that is contactless and operated via proximity to a reader. 

#### Smart Cards

*Smart Cards* are a form of **certificate-based #authentication and are usually paired with other validation methods.**  Integrated card readers are built-in to your devices, but often you will need an external #USB card reader for your device.

*‘Something You Have’* authentication requires you to have something in your possession for entry.

*‘Something You Know’* authentication requires something like a #PIN or password to gain access.

#### Lock and Key

Physical *Lock and Key* systems are a **cheaper alternative to electronic locks** and these systems can be applied to most circumstances in the workplace. Often these are stored within a *Key Cabinet* with a formal check-in with auditing and time stamps.  Collateral items are often used in these situations.

#### Biometric

#Biometric #Authentication uses a stored **mathematical representation of a certain biometric feature** you possess.  These are not able to be changed in many cases, making these forms of security less-than foolproof. Biometric Factors include **retina, palm, and fingerprint scanners.**

#### Lighting

*Lighting* is important and **bright, well-placed lights are necessary to illuminate cars and passersby** with bright light and good light angles. This allows for cameras to capture more efficiently, although #infrared #camera units will likely be implemented as well.

#### Metal Detector

#Magnetometer is also known as a *Metal Detector* and is a passive scanning device for detecting metal objects on human bodies or within containers.

### MDM

*Mobile Device Management* ( #MDM) is a #centralized **control mechanism for company-owned and user-owned mobile devices.**  In the case of user-owned devices, this is known as *‘Bring Your Own Device’* or ‘ #BYOD’ and these devices will have a #partition for work related files that the #sysadmin will be able to monitor and control via the MDM.  The sysadmin can manage access control features like screen locks and #PIN number requirements.
