# Mobile Device Security 2.7

### Securing Mobiles

#### Screen Locks

*Screen Locks* for mobile devices have many methods of #authentication that restrict access.  Facial recognition, personal identification numbers, fingerprint identification, and swipe patterns are common methods of authentication for mobile devices.

#iOS devices will **erase all user data if there are 10 failed login attempts.**  

#Android will lock the device and either require a #google login or #format the device.

#### GPS and Locator

Phones have built-in #GPS and if used in conjunction with #locator applications, you can actually find your phone on a map.  These apps will **let you control the device remotely** to make noises, illuminate the display, vibrate, display messages, or format the data.

#### Updates

**Updating your device is often important for security and performance** of the device, make sure patches and updates are applied as soon as possible.

#### Full Encryption

*Full device* #encryption is the **best way to secure your device,** as with other devices we have covered. iOS 8+ encrypts all user data via their passcode.  Android 5.0+ is likely to be encrypted.

#### Remote Backup 

*Remote backup* is when your device data and configuration is able to #backup to a #cloud service.  This occurs automatically and in the case that you break or lose your device, you can obtain a new one and restore all of your data and settings by simply authenticating your identity. 

#### iOS security

#Apple #iOS has a tightly regulated closed environment for #applications, making it very difficult to design an app that can exploit a user.  **The only way to exploit an Apple product is to find a vulnerability that has not been discovered yet.**

#### Android Security

#Android devices can **install apps from anywhere,** making it much easier to perform **Trojan Horse** style attacks with enticing but compromising apps.

#### Mobile Anti-Virus

#Anti-virus and anti- #malware exist for both Android and iOS devices from third party sources.

#### Firewalls

 A #firewall is not often included with mobile device operating systems as most mobile devices send many outbound transmissions and receive few inbound requests like a PC might.

Firewalls for Android are available although they are not commonly used outside of enterprise environments needing to control mobile apps.

#### MDM

*Mobile Device Manager* ( #MDM) allows for #centralized management of both company-owned and user-owned ‘ #BYOD’ devices.  This allows an #administrator to **manage policies for apps, data, camera access, and many more controls on the company-owned device,** or within the #partition on a BYOD device. The administrator can force screen locks and #PIN prompts remotely.

#### IoT

*Internet of Things* ( #IoT) are smart devices that often use sensors to affect heating and cooling, lighting, sound, automation, video capture, air quality, and many other purposes.  These devices often work well enough but have **mediocre to weak security features** which create #vulnerabilities in your network.  It is good practice to corral these devices onto their own #subnet.
