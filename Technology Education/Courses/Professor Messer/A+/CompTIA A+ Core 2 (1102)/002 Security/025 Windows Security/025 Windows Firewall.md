# Windows Defender Firewall 2.5

### Defender Firewall

#Windows #Defender #Firewall is similar to the #anti-virus #software in that it is both **always running and scanning for threats.**  You can disable the firewall, but this is unwise and should only be done if you are actively troubleshooting or using an app that is inhibited by the firewall.  You can also set the firewall to have different configurations on a private or public #network.

You have the option of blocking all incoming connection requests, which is useful when you are using public networks or in a space where others may try to infiltrate your devices. You can even set this blocking mechanism to ignore your whitelist and block ALL connection attempts.

Using the exceptions feature allows us to #whitelist an app or feature by name and #port number.  These exceptions must be predefined via custom rules.
