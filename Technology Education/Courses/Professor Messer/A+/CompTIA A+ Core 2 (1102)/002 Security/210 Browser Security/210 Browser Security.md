# Browser Security 2.10

### Browser

When downloading from the #browser, you should always **consider the source** and make sure that it is a trusted source.  In the example of an #extension, you could **download from a third-party site and install #malware that has the same #permissions as the extension.**  ***Never click links from emails.*** Try to visit links from the manufacturer. Use #hashing to verify the download of the file matches its counterpart on the server it was received from.

#### Hashing

#Hash Checking #software is available from the command line or from the #Microsoft store.  These will examine the #SHA256 sums from files you have downloaded and **compare them with the hash values from the original ISOs on the server you received data from.** This ensures that your files were not intercepted and modified.

#### Extensions

#Extensions and #Plug-Ins **should only be downloaded from the official libraries** of the browser, or from third parties you know are trustworthy.  If you download #malware from an untrusted source, you have opened up great  #vulnerabilities within your device.

In the month of March 2021, there were 24 malicious Google Chrome extensions and over 40 malicious domains. These were threats perpetrating theft of credentials, keylogging, data theft, and screenshotting.

#### Password Storing

A Password #Vault manages all of your #credentials in a single #database that is **available to you on multiple devices and remotely.**  It can also be used to generate and change unique passwords.  There are personal and enterprise variants of this software.

Your #browser checks sites for sketchy activity by **scanning for invalid certificates, times, and signatures from the server accessed.** Matching system times is an important part of secure connections.  

The **lock on your browser #URL bar will show you certificate details** about the site you are requesting access to. ***Invalid #certificates and security alerts on sites you are visiting is a red flag.***  This may result from **expired or incorrect domain names, invalid certificate signatures, or time and date discrepancies.**

#Pop-up *Blockers* **prevent additional windows and notifications from rendering** when you visit a site or application. This should be enabled most of the time unless you are troubleshooting or need to access a pop-up window on a site.

*Private data* includes browsing data and the contents of the #cache.  Browser data includes **search history, saved passwords, downloads list.**  The cache contains website data stored locally for faster access in the future. You need to clear both browsing data and the cache to clear your private data.

*Private Browsing* **stores less data from your web sessions** which is useful for both privacy and troubleshooting efforts.  When the browser is closed, there will be no search history, download list, or cache data.  It **still yields information to your #ISP and the sites you are communicating with.**

*Browser synchronization* can be implemented across multiple devices and locations, putting things like your favorites and browsing history on multiple devices.

*Ad Blockers* are standard for many modern browsers and protect your data from sites you visit.  This is undesirable for some people that WANT sites to recognize them, so these settings can be set to very specific preferences.
