# Security Vulnerabilities 2.4

### Operating Environments

*Standard Operating Environments* ( #SOE) are a **set of approved #hardware and #software systems that have been tested and verified to run together** – often a standard operating system **image of this SOE will be created for easy implementation** into new and updated devices.  The SOE will need to have all current patches, #OS updates, #anti-virus signatures, and will be verified before it is said to be ‘in compliance’. Anything that does not meet these standards is a *Non-Compliant System.*

To stay compliant, you can use system control to apply policies that prevent devices from running until they are compliant. A modern #firewall can monitor application traffic across the #network and perform scans for non-compliant apps and systems.  The firewall will require corrections before the device is able to access the system again.

#Microsoft *Patch Tuesday* is the **second Tuesday of each month at 10:00 PST.**  All of these new devices will need to be patched otherwise they will remain vulnerable.  **You may need to patch thousands of systems on your network** – miss one of them and this will be the weak link in your #network that attackers identify and exploit.

Sometimes a #security issue will prevent applications from working without additional management.  The ***manufacturer may tell you to disable #anti-virus or your #firewall as a solution, but this is an insecure method*** and permanently disabling your security software is not an option.

*End of Life* ( #EOL) and *End of Service Life* ( #EOSL) are two concerns for all operating systems.  **End of Life indicates when a manufacturer will stop selling an Operating System** – but may continue supporting it with patches and updates during this time. **End of Service Life indicates that support will no longer be available for this #OS** – no further updates or patches will happen.  There are exceptions to this where a client may pay a premium to continue to get updates from the manufacturer.

*Bring Your Own Device* ( #BYOD ) ***is a security threat because the owner of the device may develop an infection or threat that could compromise the partitioned company data*** on the same device.
