# Denial of Service 2.4

### DOS Attacks

*Denial of Service* ( #DOS) attacks **attempt to overburden a service via increased traffic or exploitation of a #vulnerability.**  This overtaxes the servers that host the service to make them unavailable and the entire enterprise is rendered inoperable.  This could be done to gain a competitive advantage, revenge, or preparation for #DNS #spoofing.

### Attack Types

#### Friendly

A *‘friendly’ DOS attack* is an **unintentional problem caused by an internal member.**  Examples include exceeding **bandwidth during events, creating a Layer 2 loop on the network without #STP, or if environmental hazards** are present in the #datacenter and #hardware must be shut down.

#### Dedicated (DDOS)

*Distributed Denial of Service* ( #DDOS) is a complicated method of attack that involves many, **many computers to cause a spike in #bandwidth via incoming requests.**  You could use a single computer to perform theses attacks, but a single device is easily identified and targeted for screening. 

#### Botnets

A #Botnet enables attackers to perform powerful DDoS attacks by **using others’ computers to concentrate an organized and timed attack.**  The Botnet will infect thousands of computers, and when the time comes, these **computers will unknowingly be used to perform massive DDoS attacks.**  Zues Botnet infected 3.6 million PCs to perform coordinated attacks.

Modern technology has defenses against #DDoS style attacks.  Your firewall may be able to identify traffic patterns that correlate with #botnet infection and DDoS attacks. Your #ISP may have anti-DDoS systems implemented already. #CloudFlare is a common technology to defend against these problems.
