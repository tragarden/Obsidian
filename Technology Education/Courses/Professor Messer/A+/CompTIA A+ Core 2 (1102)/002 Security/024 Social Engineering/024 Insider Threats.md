# Inside Threats 2.4

### Insiders

*Inside threats* are always a possibility and happen when **someone with intimate knowledge and access within an organization uses their access to find #vulnerabilities and weaknesses** within and use them to their own advantage. 

Some insider threats will even **recruit others within the organization to yield data or access by offering them cryptocurrencies.**  The only way to counter this currently is to backup to prevent #ransomware attacks and to practice good #security measures at all times.
