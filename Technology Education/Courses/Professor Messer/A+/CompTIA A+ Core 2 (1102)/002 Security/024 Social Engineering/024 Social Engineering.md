# Social Engineering 2.4

### Social Engineering

*Social engineering* methods are constantly changing as people get used to older methods of persuasion.  At this point, you may be contacted by multiple people, organizations, and methods as scammers try to build your trust and gain access to your information. They may come in the form of aggressive and angry customers, and funeral notifications and imposters have also been known methods of attack.

### Types of Social Engineering

#### Phishing

#Phishing attacks are when an **attacker pretends to be a trusted or familiar source,** and these attacks are often **perpetrated via #email and phone interactions.** Check the #URL of links before you click them and verify, they are from a secure and trusted site – not a scam site posing as a legitimate company.  Typically, you will see typos, improper font styles and sizes, and pixelated or incorrect logos.

*Spear Phishing* is when **inside information is used to determine specific targets within a network.**  Usually targets include people that have access to money, and the term ‘whaling’ applies to targeting major roles in an organization like a CFO. 

#### Spoofing

Caller ID #spoofing is a **common method of attack where someone calls you but changes the number to appear as if it is a friend or local** number. They will often say they are from the bank or a loan organization and that you are in financial trouble – desperate attention is needed immediately.

#### Shoulder Surfing

**Shoulder Surfing** is when you **actively watch someone’s screen** with your own eyes or binoculars.  This will allow you to observe someone’s actions, passwords, or whatever else they may be doing on their device.  Essentially a malicious form of eavesdropping.

To prevent shoulder surfing you should **face your screen towards walls,** not windows.  Be conscientious about who is around you while working.  If you need to work in a small area like a plane, you can **get privacy filters that obscure your screen image** from people near you.  

***Do not sit in front of Professor Messer because he will definitely shoulder surf you!!!!***

#### Tailgating and Piggybacking

#Tailgating and #Piggybacking is when **someone physically enters the door at the expense of another worker** that is lax in their trust or occupied with other activities and the infiltrator sneaks in.  ***Tailgating refers to sneaking in, and piggybacking refers to someone consenting to letting the attacker in.***

Users of the building should be able to **identify anyone they work with, either by familiarity or a nametag** provided to visitors. **One person should enter the building per entry,** and sometimes organizations will use mechanical methods to ensure this such as an *Airlock or Access Control Vestibule.* Asking unidentified people why they are present is more important than polite disregard.

#### Impersonations

#Impersonation is **the main way people get into secure areas.** They pretend to be a part of the organization **by being friendly, pretending to be a higher rank, using credentials of another** employee, or **using a lot of technical jargon to confuse** anyone questioning their authority.

#### Dumpster Diving

*Dumpster Diving* is the practice of **stealing credentials or information from a dumpster or other receptacle** for company data.  Thieves will note the times and regularity of which things are disposed of from a target organization.  They can **build their models for impersonation** from the information they collect out of the trash.

#### Decoy Devices

The *‘Wireless Evil Twin’* is a method of **installing your own hardware, such as an access point, into an organization and giving it the same credentials as the current access points.** Users within the building will connect to this AP with their credentials thinking it is part of the organization’s hardware network.  In cases like this, **using #HTTPS and a #VPN will protect you from these methods of attack.**
