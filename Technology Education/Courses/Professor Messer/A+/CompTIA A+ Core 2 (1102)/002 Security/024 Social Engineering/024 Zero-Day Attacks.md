# Zero-Day Attacks 2.4

### Zero-Day

A *Zero-Day Attack* is when someone exploits a #vulnerability **that has not been detected or published yet.** These attacks are becoming more popular and both defense researchers and attackers study new #applications and updates persistently, hoping they will find the next major exploit.

The #Log4j remote code execution vulnerability was introduced to millions of servers running an #Apache service that used a Java-based logging utility.  This happened on September 14th, 2013, but it took until December 14th for someone to exploit it.  This was considered one of the most severe threats of all time and compromised millions of servers until it was fixed 5 days later.
