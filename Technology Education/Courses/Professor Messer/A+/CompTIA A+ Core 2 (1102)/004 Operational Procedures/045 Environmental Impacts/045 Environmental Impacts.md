# Environmental Impacts 4.5

### Considerations

#### MSDS

*Material Safety Data Sheets* ( #MSDS, sometimes #SDS) are **distributed by the US Department of Labor and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration** ( #OSHA) and provide information about hazardous chemicals found in batteries, displays, solvents, cans, toner, and ink cartridges.

#MSDS sheets contain information about the product and company, such as:

- Composition and ingredients
- Known Hazards
- First Aid measures
- Fire-fighting measures
- Leak or release protocols
- Handling and Storage protocols
#### Batteries

Batteries and #toner are both examples of **toxic waste** that needs to be handled appropriately.  **Toner should be recycled and reused** as many manufacturers provide a return box providing a discount for returned cartridges.

#### Climate Control

*Rooms Controls* like temperature, humidity, and ventilation are vital considerations in mitigating environmental problems.  **Humidity level must be high enough to lower #ESD but low enough to prevent condensation on the interior of devices.**  Constant cooling and **airflow is important for both #hardware and people.**

#### Power Supplies

*Uninterruptible Power Supplies* rely on a #battery backup to **provide emergency power during power failures, under-voltage events, and power surges.** This includes **Standby #UPS, Line-Interactive UPS, and On-Line UPS systems** that may have features such as auto-shutdown, battery monitoring, power outlets, and phone line suppression.

#### Surge Suppressors

*Surge Suppressors* **divert power spikes to the ground** during electrical storms, power surges, power grid fluctuations, and self-inflicted noise and surges.  These devices have *Joule* ratings – the higher the better and while there are models accommodating 200 and 400 joules, seek a device that protects against at least 600 Joules.  Verify that the *Surge Amp Rating* is high enough for your system. 

*UL 1449 Voltage Let-Through Rating*s **determine the amount of voltage that may pass through the device,** lower numbers are desirable.

#### Noise Filters

*Noise Filters* remove noise from power lines and have their performance indicated by a decibel (Db) level specified.
