# Scripting Languages 4.8

### Scripts

#Scripts are used to **automate tasks or operating systems** and is an increasingly important skill for technicians.

#### Batch Files

#Batch Files (.bat) are the #extensions for scripting on #Windows via command line. This is #legacy technology from the #DOS and OS/2 era.

#### PowerShell

Windows #PowerShell (.ps1) is a **command line environment for Windows** that has added functionality and features – essentially a more powerful version of the command line available through the #terminal. PowerShell is now included with every variant of Windows 10 and 11.

#PowerShell is **useful for providing automation for the Operating System,** and #VBScript is **useful for providing #automation for #applications.**

*Shell Scripts* are **how scripts are able to be automated from the command line in #Unix / #Linux shells.** These scripts are **indicated by a #shebang ‘#!’ at the beginning of the file.**  This symbol combination is called a ‘shebang’ or a ‘ #hash-bang’ and seeing one at the top of a file usually **indicates a .sh file extension.**

#### Command-lets

#Command-lets ( #cmdlets) are standalone #executables used  to run #PowerShell #scripts and other functions. With PowerShell and cmdlets, we can **automate system #administrator tasks and manage the Active #Domain.**

#### Visual Basic Scripting

*Visual Basic Scripting* ( #VBScript) (.vbs) is a **general-purpose scripting language for Windows that is useful for #back-end server, Windows desktop scripting, and scripting within MS #Office** applications.

#### JavaScript

#JavaScript (.js) **facilitates #scripting within your #browser and is used in conjunction with #HTML and #CSS** to make almost every website you have ever been to.  This is NOT the same as Java.

#### Python

#Python (.py) is a **general-purpose scripting language that is widely used and supported** with broad appeal.  It is easy to implement and common on many different operating systems.
