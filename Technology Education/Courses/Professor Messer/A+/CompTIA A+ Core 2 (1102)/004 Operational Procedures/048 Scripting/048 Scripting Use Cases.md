# Scripting Use 4.8

### Automation

Basic #Automation is used to **solve problems without human intervention** at speeds much faster than what a human being is capable of.  You will be able to **monitor and resolve issues before you’re even aware of them.** This reduced required manpower, human error, and allows humans to perform more creative work.

#### Restarts

*Automated restarts* are useful for application updates, #security patches, and troubleshooting for a once-a-day restart to correct any active bugs.  Automating these **restarts saves time where an employee would be idly waiting by** for the device to become available.

#### Network Drives

*Remapping #network drives* is another call for automation since we may need to **map a drive to a user account upon every startup or need to temporarily map to a device** to retrieve data.  We can also **automate #software changes and movements of user data.**

#### Application Installs

*Automating Application installations* is useful for turning this into a hands-off process that saves significant time. With automation, you can **automatically assign and map drives, bypass user prompts during installation, automatically disconnect and un-map the drive, then restart** the system without using physical media or human interaction.

#### Backups

Automating #backups are useful so all system data can be backed up each night or daily during off-hours.

#### Monitoring and Reporting

*Automated monitoring and reporting* of remote devices, performance monitoring, inventory management techniques, software configuration, patching, and security and #vulnerability scans saves a lot of time and energy.

You can also initiate updates for #OS's, device #drivers, and #applications.

#### Warnings

Be careful when using automation – ***one mistake could be replicated across thousands of devices.*** If you automate the downloading of an application hosting malware, your entire system will be infected with #malware. Very bad.

Sometimes **you may accidentally change a system setting and configure many devices with the wrong settings,** be careful!

**One single character within a script can cause catastrophic changes to your network** and cause #browser and system crashes, leading to mishandling of resources and loss of data.

***ALWAYS #SANDBOX TEST SCRIPTS BEFORE #DEPLOYMENT!!!!***
