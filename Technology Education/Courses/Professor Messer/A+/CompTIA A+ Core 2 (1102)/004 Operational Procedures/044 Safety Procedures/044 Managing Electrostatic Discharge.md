# Electrostatic Discharge 4.4

### Static Electricity

#Static Electricity is **unmoving electric charges that seemingly are trapped in a space.**  While static electricity itself is not a threat to electronics, it is damaging if this energy is discharged or released.

#### Discharge

Electrostatic #Discharge can be around ***3,500 volts – silicon is sensitive to high voltage*** and an **electronic component may be damaged by just 100 volts.**

*Relative Humidity* ratings of **>60% cuts down on the potential for #ESD,** but this is uncommon, and many office spaces use air conditioning which drastically lowers humidity.

***Use your hand to ‘self-ground’ by touching the metal chassis of the device, unplug the device from the power source,*** before touching any internal components. 

***DO NOT GROUND YOURSELF TO AN ELECTRICAL SYSTEM OR BUILDING GROUND.  ALWAYS UNPLUG YOUR DEVICE FROM A POWER SOURCE BEFORE WORKING ON YOUR DEVICE.***

*Anti-Static Straps, Pads, Mats, and Bags* are commonly used technology for working on devices.  Straps **ground humans to the metal casing,** pads ground the technology from surfaces, mats ground your feet from the floor, and bags allow us to safely move components.

Make sure when you are handling #hardware components, to **only touch the edges of cards and try to use original packaging for storage and shipping.** Parts should be **stored in an HVAC supported environment between 50-80 degrees Fahrenheit with low humidity.**  If you are concerned about humidity, use **silica gel packs** to eliminate humidity.  If you do not have original boxes, wrap items in bubble wrap with silica gel packs in a cardboard box.
