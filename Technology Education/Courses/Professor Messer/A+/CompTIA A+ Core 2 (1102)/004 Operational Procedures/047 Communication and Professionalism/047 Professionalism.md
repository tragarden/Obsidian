# Professionalism 4.7

### Considerations

#### Attire

*Attire* should be matched to the current working environment, **observe what your management team wears and modify your style accordingly.** Some places have very lax policies for dress.

#### Remember

**You are a teacher in your work environment, not an enforcer.** Work to make people smarter, not bitter. **Be sensitive to people’s official titles and respectful of cultural differences.**

***You will make giant mistakes – always remember them.***

#### Inviting Environment

*Create an environment for conversation* both in-person and over the phone.  When talking with someone, **avoid distractions like texting or external conversations.** Create a welcoming space in your office for conversation, and when on the phone maintain a quiet background off of speakerphone.

#### Arguments

***Avoid arguments with co-workers and avoid being dismissive, contradictory, or defensive.*** Try to **diffuse and deescalate situations and focus on building relationships.** Maintain communication even if there is no update available. ***DO NOT post on social media about workplace altercations.***

#### Confidentiality

*Maintaining Confidentiality* is important as you will likely oversee much of people’s personal and private information.  This same respect should be afforded to corporate data as well.
