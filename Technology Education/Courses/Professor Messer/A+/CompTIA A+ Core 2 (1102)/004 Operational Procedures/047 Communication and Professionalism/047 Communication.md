# Communication 4.7

### Communication Skills

Communication skills are highly valued in most industries and computer technology is no different.  Communicating is a powerful skill for troubleshooting and **being a skilled communicator makes you incredibly marketable.**

#### Jargon

#Jargon can be incredibly useful when talking to peers with IT knowledge but **can be confusing and complicated for others** that do not have the same knowledge.  Acronyms and slang can be confusing for users, and ***you will need to be the median of translation,*** creating understanding of your knowledge in a simpler form that laymen understand. **Know your audience and adjust your vocabulary and jargon accordingly.**

#### Attitude

A *Positive attitude* ***including positive tone of voice*** **will convey respect and optimism** to your work mates and increase the confidence of the group.  Problems will not always be fixed, so be ready to let someone down and offer alternative helpful options to them when something doesn’t work out.

#### Active Listening 

*Active Listening* is very important – you should **avoid interrupting even if you think you have the answer.** Politely listen to the full scope of the description from the client, **take notes about what they are saying,** and work on building a relationship with the client.

#### Clarifying Questions

*Clarifying Questions* are **useful for securing the details of a situation, avoiding conflict, and avoiding judgement.** Never make assumptions even if you think the answer is obvious.

#### Repetition

*Repeating the details* of the customer statement back to them **reinforces understanding, highlights discrepancies, and reduces misunderstandings** – ultimately leading to a faster resolution for all parties.

#### Customer Expectations

*Customer Expectations* **should be clearly set so that they understand if they are to expect a repair or replacement and updating them with a timeline** and the beginning and during the repair is important. **Keep them informed regularly** even if no progress has been made. #Document all exchanges and verify customer satisfaction at the end of the experience.
