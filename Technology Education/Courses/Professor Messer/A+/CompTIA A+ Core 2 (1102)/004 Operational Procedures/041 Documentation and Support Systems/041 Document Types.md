# Document Types 4.1

### Common Document Types

#### AUP

*Acceptable Use Policies* ( #AUP) defines the acceptable terms of use and **Rules of Behavior* for accessing devices and technology within an organization.**  This is used by the organization to limit legal liabilities, if someone is misusing company property, they will be dismissed with documentation.

#### Topology

#Network #Topology can be **depicted in a graphical diagram** illustrating the relational layout of the system.

#### Compliance

#Compliance is a **set of standards that must be met to ensure an organization is abiding by the laws, regulations, and policies of the region** they operate within. This can extend to include international requirements.  If uncompliant, an organization is subject to penalties such as fines and attention, whereas the individual may lose their job or end up imprisoned in rare cases.

#### Splash Screens

*Splash Screens* are **messages or other windows shown at login** that can be used to reinforce compliance in the user.  They are commonly used to #broadcast maintenance #notifications, system changes, updates, or warnings.

#### Incident Reporting

*Incident Reporting* is a vital #security policy and documentation for any incident must be available, and ongoing incidents require active updating according to the incident plan.  This will serve as a reference for all future related incidents.

### Standard Operating Procedures

*Standard Operating Procedures* are **routinely performed processes and procedures** that the staff needs to be notified of, especially in the event of system downtime or facility closures. #Software installation and upgrades to systems have standard practices that must be followed. All of these procedures require detailed documentation, so everyone is familiar with and understands the policies.

#### On-Boarding

#On-Boarding is when **a new person enters the organization,** and there are procedures for this on-boarding process. There should be a **checklist** for incoming new users, as well as an **employee handbook or separate #AUP.**  You will need to **create accounts, set #permissions, acquire #hardware and devices, and configure the systems** for the new user.

#### Off-Boarding

#Off-Boarding is when **someone leaves an organization** and there should be a predetermined process for their exit.  Account information is often deactivated, but not deleted.  Their hardware and data need to be managed somehow, and this should be explained in the off-boarding process literature provided.

#### Knowledge Base

The *Knowledge base* for your organization should **include a mix of external sources such as the manufacturer, internal documentation, and a searchable archive of problems and their solutions.** These **searches should be automated** to some extent.
