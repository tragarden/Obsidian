# Ticketing Systems 4.1

### Tickets

*Tickets* are a **standard method of documenting a complaint, assigning it to a technician, resolving the issue, and reporting the outcome.** Typically, this falls under the responsibilities of the *Help Desk* who will take the incoming calls, determine the course of action and implementation order, then assign the #ticket and monitor the outcome.

*After a ticket is submitted* by a client, the **information gathering phase begins.**  Collect as much **information about the device, user, and problem.**  Apply context to the situation by **assigning a level of severity, determining the need for escalation, and categorizing the problem** for the right department. Clear communication is important when collecting this information, notes about progress, and conclusionary details about the problem resolution.

*Customer names* are often **stored within a name service in the Active Directory** or similar system.  Sometimes this information is automatically integrated into the Active Directory by an #email #gateway or other portal.  Always confirm contact information when you are talking to a user, as this can change at any time.

**Device information should describe the device and its location. **

The *Description field* is the **most important part of the ticket details and should have a clear and concise explanation of the problem** that includes the necessary details. Indicating the severity of the problem in the description is important for the next person when determining urgency.

Categories are broad descriptions giving clues as to what type of problem is occurring. Is it hardware, software, network, etc.

**Severity is usually ranked low, medium, high, and critical,** establishing a set of standards and urgency.

*Escalation levels* are for determining the correct technician for a specific issue. If you don’t know the skill set of a specific tech, you can escalate to a group of employees designated for certain tasks.

*Progress notes* are for the many people that will see the ticket, explaining what the problem was and how the situation has evolved after multiple techs have attempted to fix the issue.

*Problem resolution* documents the solution to the ticket problem and can be later referenced by other people solving similar issues.  This creates an active knowledge base for solving customer problems.
