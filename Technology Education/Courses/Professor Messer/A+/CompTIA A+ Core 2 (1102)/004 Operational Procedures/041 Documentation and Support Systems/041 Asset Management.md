# Asset Management 4.1

### Asset Management

*Asset Management* is the **monitoring and auditing of technology** within a company.  Almost all devices within the company should ***have a record of the devices’ make and model, configuration, financial records, purchase data, #hardware components, location,*** and many other metrics. Many of these devices will have an *Asset Tag* **associated with a barcode, #RFID chip, tracking number, or organization name.**

#### Asset Database

The Asset #Database is a #centralized **tracking system for the organization’s equipment.** These devices **will be assigned dedicated users** which is useful for tracking the health and evolution of a device.  This database can ***keep track of warranties, deadlines, and licensing,*** which is useful for forecasting financial changes and budgeting for upcoming / increased costs.

#### Budget and Purchases

The purchasing process begins with a request from a user, which often includes budget information and formal approvals.  After the requests are known, a negotiation of costs and terms and conditions with the suppliers will begin. Finally, the organization will receive an invoice, and the money will be exchanged at the point of purchase.
