# Privacy, Listening, and Policies 4.6

### Incident Response

For *Incident Response* scenarios, it is important to **maintain control over evidence,** so that the integrity of the report is maintained.  **Monitor and record everyone who has access and contacts the evidence to avoid tampering.**  Label and catalogue anything related to the case and **protect the data with digital signatures.**

#### First Responders

*First Responders* are responsible **for identifying the issue and taking any reasonable #mitigation measures** possible during this discovery.  **Log this data and have an in-person discussion** with first responders. This information **may need to be relayed through channels of authority, and sometimes law enforcement agencies.** Make sure you log anything you can about this related incident and keep this data secured.

#### Copying Drives

*Copying drives in a bit-by-bit + byte-by-byte manner* is important in the event of an incident.  **Remove any physical drives from the device if possible and preserve the data using a #hardware write-blocker.** You can use #software #imaging tools to put this data onto #boot media for restoring the #OS at a later time.  Use #hash verification methods to verify data integrity.

#### Creating Documentation

#Documentation for the incident is **crucial for both internal purposes and legal proceedings.** This should be a **summary of information related to the incident or security event.** This would be followed by a **detailed explanation of the methods for data acquisition and a report of the findings** and conclusion.

#### Licensing

*Licensing agreements* for #software are a **set of terms and conditions** that the user must follow while using the licensed item.  Terms considered include **type of use, number of copies, backup options, and license type.**

##### Types of Licensing

#Per-seat licensing will allot a **certain amount of licenses issued to specific team members.**

#Concurrent licensing abides by a **limit on the number of software instances running** at one time.

#Non-expired licenses include **ongoing subscriptions or software with an expiration date.**

*Personal licensing* is designed for **home users** and often associated with a single device or small group of devices.  These are **usually a one-time purchase**.

*Corporate use licensing* is usually **per-seat or site-wide licensing** where the software is installed on every device for the organization. **Annual renewal** is a common way to buy these licenses.

*Free and Open Source* ( #FOSS) licenses are **freely available and can be modified by the user** and compiled to create their own executables.

#Closed-source / *Commercial licenses* have #proprietary and **private source code, and the end user has limited options for compiling and executing.** #Apple is an example of this sort of licensing.

#### EULA

The *End User Licensing Agreement* ( #EULA) is a **legal statement about how the #software and license are allowed to be used** and any other caveats from the manufacturer.

#### Credit Card Security

*Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard* ( #PCI-DSS) is a **national standard for protecting credit cards** and their data.  This is based on six objectives for control:

- Build and Maintain Secure Networks and Systems
- Protect Cardholder Data
- Maintain a #Vulnerability Management Program
- Implement Strong *Access Control* Measures
- Regularly *Monitor and Test Networks*
- Maintain an Information *Security Policy*

#### Government Issued Information 

*Personal Government Issued Information* ( #PGII) includes documents like **birth certificates, social security numbers, and drivers’ licenses.** There may be laws and restrictions on collecting and storing data related to these identification items. 

The *U.S. Office of Personnel Management* ( #OPM) had a data leak in 2015 which compromised the SSNs, DOBs, job assignments, and other Personnel files for more than 21.5 million people.

#### Personally Identifiable Information

*Personally Identifiable Information* ( #PII) is **included in your privacy policy** and is accessed with such regularity that many people forget the importance in securing this information.  When attackers gain this information, they are able to breach bank accounts and provide the answers to your password reset questions.

#### Data Protection Regulations

*General Data Protection Regulation* ( #GDPR) is a regulation enforced by the European Union to **ensure data protection and privacy for citizens** of the #EU.  Name, address, photos, emails, bank information, social media posts, medical records, IP addresses, and many more metrics are protected under these laws.  Users control the exporting of their personal data and give them rights of erasure if they do not want someone to possess their information. A *Site Privacy Policy* **must be posted to detail all the rights for a user** of the website.

#### Protected Health Information

*Protected Health Information* ( #PHI) is the **health status, care records, and payment records** associated with an individual.  Data exchange between providers must adhere to certain security requirements.  *Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Ac*t of 1996 ( #HIPAA) regulations are the reason for these protections.

#### Data Retention Requirements

*Data Retention Requirements* ensure that **version control systems ( #VCS) are maintained.**   This allows you to **revert to a previous system state** and can be used to recover from virus infections.  **Often these are legally required**: you may need to retain emails for several years, retain all data of certain types, and sensitive records like corporate tax filings, customer #PII, and other methods of backup.
