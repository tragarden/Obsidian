# Change Management 4.2

### Change Management

*Change Management* refers to **a system of checks and balances that are to be observed whenever a change is made to any software or hardware within the organization.**  Examples include **#software upgrades, application patches, reconfiguration of the #firewall, alteration of #switch ports, or addition of new #hardware.**  There should be a clear process and policies for the frequency, duration, process, and #recovery procedures. If an organization lacks *Change Management,* you will find it difficult to implement as there will be much resistance from the current staff.

*Rollback Plans* exist for when the execution of a new change is not desirable or functional.  It **allows the entire system to run to a previous point** in time that worked properly.

#Sandbox Testing is typically an **isolated testing environment that is not connected to the #network and can be erased with no consequences.**  It is often used before making major changes to existing systems, and to make sure that the system in question is working properly before deployment.  This is also a useful testing environment to ensure that a previous #restore point is valid before a rollback.

*Organization Sponsors* are the **people requesting or enforcing changes** and are responsible for funding the process and collecting the money made from it. 

The #IT **Teams are responsible for implementing the changes requested** by the *Organization Sponsors.*

The *business customer* is the person **interested in purchasing or using the product** being created.

The formal process for change management exists to **avoid downtime, confusion, and mistakes** during this transition.  The process often ***includes completion of forms, a clearly determined purpose for changes, the scope of these changes, the schedule, risk analysis, approval through chain of command, and end-user acceptance of the changes.***

*Change Control Request Forms* are the **formal process for requesting changes.**  This yields transparency and contains detailed reports and statistics, managed in an easily used online system.

The *Purpose of changes* must be obvious and well established as changes are costly in both time and money. 

The *Scope of the changes* need to be expressed clearly, **including logistics, range of affect, and duration.** This must be considered when scheduling changes.

*Risk Analysis* **determines the severity of a threat and how to mitigate** any negative outcomes.  Risk is graded from high, medium, to low, and can be further described as a #vulnerability with an application, #security, or unexpected downtimes. The change or ‘repair’ may break unexpected parts of the system, corrupt data, or crash the operating systems.

A *Change Board* is the **group responsible for approving the changes with representatives from all branches of the organization** since these changes often affect all parts of the organization. The board schedules the changes and prioritizes steps.

*End-User Acceptance* is the final and most important aspect of change management.  Those using the applications or networks in question need to agree that the implementation is successful and acceptable.  Keeping the users involved in the process and openly communicating is important for observing their needs and input.
