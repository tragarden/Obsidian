# Removing Malware 3.3

### Tools for Removal

Using **third party tools to remove** #malware can help, but it is never the best practice, as there may be **remnants of malware remaining.**  Revert to a previously known-good #backup or reinstall the #OS for the best removal methods.  In the case that this is not an option, you may need to get the system operational enough to recover data.

#### Procedure for Removal

1. Identify Malware

*Malware Symptoms* include **application failure, #security alerts, unusual error messages, slow booting, slow applications, and other performance issues.**

2. Quarantine

To #Quarantine properly, you will need to **disconnect from your #network wirelessly and from physical connections.** Any #storage **media that can be removed should be isolated and unused.** Do not transfer files or #backup data, it may all be infected.

3. Disable System Restore

*Disabling System* #Restore may be necessary as **malware could have infected your restore points leaving your previous configuration points as compromised** as your current one.  The option to *‘Disable system protection’* **will remove all restore points.**

4. Remediation / a. Update Anti-Virus / b. Scan and Remove

- Signatures for the #anti-virus #software must be updated often because they have a short active time. Sometimes **malware will set the updates to ‘manual’ which is not practical for almost any user.** This is meant for troubleshooting purposes and should not be enabled.

After updating,** run your scanner and use its malware removal tools** to recover your system to the best possible extent.  Once you have removed anything found, **backup whatever files of concern and isolate the drive** after you save files to it.

Use *Safe Mode* if you are unable to access your desktop normally.  It will run a skeletal version of the OS that limits the actions of malware.  This may be enough to access the files you need and recover them. 

The *Pre-Installation Environment* ( #WinPE) has a #recovery console where you can attempt repairs.  New *bootable media* can be used as well.  You may have to rebuild parts of the file system using this interface or the *Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit* ( #ADK).  You may have to repair #boot sectors and records.

5. Use the #scheduler within your antivirus software or the *Task Scheduler* to **schedule scans and updates** for your operating system and defensive software.

6. Now that the *system is free of malware,* you can once again **Enable System Protection and allow for the creation of new restore points.**

7. Educate your end user via one-on-one training, signage, message boards both physical and digital, login screen messages, and the homepage for browsers.
