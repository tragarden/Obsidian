# Troubleshooting Mobile Devices 3.4

### Diagnostics

If you experience an *app that doesn’t load or is performing poorly,* **restart your phone** as a first attempt at a fix.  Make sure the app is updated to the latest version.  Stop the app specifically and restart it from your app management interface.

#iPhone: double-tap home slide up, slide app up

#Android: Settings/Apps, select app, force stop

#### Applications

*Apps the fail to close or continuously crash* can often be **remedied by restarting the device.** Updating the app is another easy step that may solve issues with performance.  Delete and reinstall the app if these methods do not work.

If your app is not updating correctly, **try manually upgrading in the app store** to force the upgrade process.  Some apps will require payment credentials before they will be able to be updated.  **Restart your device and attempt the upgrade again.**

If your #OS will not update features, #bug fixes, and #security features, there are a few things to check.  **Verify that there is enough storage space** on your device to accommodate the data.  Sometimes there are #bandwidth **limits impeding our ability to download more data,** you can try a different connection method as the update server may be down. Restarting your device is often useful.

#### Batteries

When #battery life seems inadequate, **check the battery usage #utility** to see if there are any obvious causes of excessive power consumption. 

#iOS / #iPadOS: Settings/Battery

#Android: Settings/Battery

Sometimes technological impediments like **bad reception or an aging battery** are responsible for short battery life. **If your device is constantly sending a #ping in search of a signal, the battery will drain from these extra transmissions.** If these metrics seem fine, disable unnecessary features like #Bluetooth, #GPS, or #Wi-Fi 802.11 #wireless signals.

#### Random Restarts

If you experience random restarts, check to make sure your OS and apps are updated.  You can perform a #hardware check to observe the #battery health.  If you contact tech support, they should be able to see a list of *crash logs* from the device to help you diagnose ongoing issues.

#### Limited Connectivity

If you experience spotty #connectivity or inconsistent signal, **try moving your physical position in relation to the access point you are using,** or try another access point.

If you have *No #Wi-Fi connection,* **make sure it is enabled and verify that you have entered the most recent password** for the system.  Sometimes a reset of the #network is required in these situations.

If you have *no #Bluetooth connectivity,* **make sure it is enabled and that both the client and device for pairing are available.**  A hard reset of the Bluetooth system on both devices can often clear up these issues.

If you have *no #NFC connectivity,* **try resetting your device** as there are few troubleshooting options for these problems.  Sometimes this is related to your payment option and that card may need to be removed and replaced.  **Some NFC devices can disallow connections.**

If #AirDrop is not working properly, **make sure you are closer than 30 feet to the device** being communicated with. ***Turn on both #Wi-Fi and #Bluetooth, as AirDrop uses both of these technologies in unison.***  You may not be discoverable, so check the AirDrop discovery options under **‘allow me to be discovered by ‘.**

#### Auto-Rotate

If the *screen is not autorotating,* first check to see if you have **enabled screen rotation lock.**  If it is a problem with the app, try restarting the app, and restarting the device if that does not resolve the issue.  Sometimes you may have to contact customer support, and **sometimes the sensor may have failed.**
