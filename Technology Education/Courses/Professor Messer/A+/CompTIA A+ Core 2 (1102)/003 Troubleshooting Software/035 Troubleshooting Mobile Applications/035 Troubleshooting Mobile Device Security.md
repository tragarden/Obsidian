# Troubleshooting Mobile Security 3.5

### Common Issues with Mobile Security

#### APK

#Android *Package Kit* ( #APK) files from untrusted sources are the **main source of #malware for mobile devices.** Once it is installed to your device, it gains a lot of access. #iOS devices have apps that are screened and curated by #Apple to reduce opportunities for malware distribution.

#### Developer Mode

Developer Mode enables features like #USB #debugging, #memory statistics, and demo mode.  #iOS and #iPadOS can **enter developer mode by enabling** #Xcode.  #Android developer mode can be enabled by going to **Settings > About Phone** and tapping the build number 7 times.

#### Jailbreaking / Rooting

#Jailbreaking ( #Apple) or #Root Access ( #Android) to your device means that you are **bypassing the #OS installed by the manufacturer in favor of a custom #firmware** which replaces the operating system.  This allows a user to bypass #security features, sideload apps outside of the app store, and disable #administrator control from the #MDM.

#### Spoofing

#Application #Spoofing is when you **install a seemingly legitimate application that is actually #malware imitating the official product.**  Always inspect a download link and verify that the manufacture and application are legitimate before you yield control and #permissions to an unknown source.  In 2021 Google removed 150 apps from the store that were posing as different apps.

#### Traffic

*High Network Traffic* or rates of data exchange can be an indication of #malware, command and control attacks, or #proxy networks.  **Check the built in diagnostics** or get a third-party reporting application.  **Run a malware scan** to see if you’ve been affected.

*Data-limit* notifications are built-in to #Android devices (not iOS) and can be an **indication that your have been infected by malware.**  You can **set a traffic / data limit** and receive notifications when that limit is exceeded. **Run a malware scan** if you observe this behavior.

#### Slow Response

*Sluggish responses* like screen lags and poor input response, first **try restarting the device. Next, update the apps and #OS,** which may fix bugs in the code. Close any apps that may be hogging resources.  If all else fails, perform a factory reset as a last resort.

#### Limited Connectivity

*Limited network connectivity* could be an indicator of #malware – it will inhibit network connectivity as much as possible to lower the chances of being fixed.  **Try disabling and reenabling your #Wi-Fi and Airplane modes in the toggle menu.**  Restart the device and perform a malware scan.

#### Ads

*Too many ads* is a symptom of #malware and the main remedy for this is to download an anti-malware application that can identify and remove the malware you downloaded. 

#### False Notifications

*Fake Security Warnings* are a common exploit that is used to easily **trick a user into giving up #credentials.**  One click and they could steal credit card information, passwords, browser history, and text messages data.  Run a #malware removal tool if you encounter fake security warnings on your system or #browser.

#### Random Restarts

Unusual behavior from an application such as **excessive delays or closings  can indicate the presence of malware.**  If features of the app are missing or the app is demanding high power consumption, this may indicate that the malware is active.  Update the app and remove it if you are unsure about its trustworthiness.

#### Root Access

*Unauthorized Account Access* or *Root Access* can indicate a data breach that leaked your personal files and credentials.  Determine what caused your data breach by scanning your apps and running anti-malware applications.  A factory reset and reinstallation of the OS will address this problem.  **Check *data leak* sources like Applie iCloud/Configurator, Google Workspace, and Microsoft #OneDrive.**  Change your passwords on vulnerable accounts.
