# Troubleshooting Security 3.2

### Security Issues

#### Symptoms

There are a few *symptoms* of active #malware on your system which include **slow performance, locking up, internet connectivity issues, and failure to update.**  If you are unable to access the #network or update, then you are left vulnerable and cannot fix your problems.

Desktop and #Browser alerts and push #notifications can be **exploited by malware to make it seem like you are experiencing security threats** and will try to get you to click malicious links that you think licensed #applications are presenting to you.

- Disabling #Browser notifications except for your #whitelist is a good way of handling this.

*False* #Anti-Virus alerts may look legitimate, claiming that you need to re-subscribe to unlock your PC or that your PC is unprotected until you enter new credit card data.  This usually must be **addressed via third-party anti-malware removal tools.**

**Renamed system files, disappearing or unintentionally encrypted files, changes to file permissions, and denial of access are all indicators that malware is on your system.**  It is advisable to use #malware removal #software or #restore your system to a previous point if this is detected.

Browser #security alerts let us know about discrepancies with the #certificates or times associated with a site and our device. You can **check the certificate details by clicking the lock in your #URL bar.**  Errors can come from **certificates or signatures expiring, being invalid, improperly signing, expired #domain, or matching time and date** between the server and your computer.  Sometimes *Clock Drift* will happen on your device and a restart or automatic clock sync can alleviate these issues.

*Browser Redirection* is most commonly caused by malware and will send you to a different website than your intended destination. Using a malware remover or reverting to a previous save is a good option for removal.

Scanning for malware or #reimaging the device to guarantee removal is a good option.
