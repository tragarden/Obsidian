# Control Panel 1.4

### Utilities of Control Panel

The utilities in the #Windows *Control Panel* are also known as an #applet.

#### Internet Options

The *Internet Options* #utility allows us to configure many different settings related to accessing the internet.

- *General* - tells us about the **display settings** of the browser, homepage, history settings.
- *Security* – allows us to **set different security frameworks** for different locations and situations.
- *Privacy* – **management for cookies, pop-ups, and InPrivate browsing** modes.
- *Content* – **management for certificates** and auto-complete settings.
- *Connections* – settings for your **VPN and proxies.**
- *Programs* – settings for **plugins and default browser** choice.
- *Advanced* – **granular management** of many connection details plus the RESET button!!
#### Devices and Printers

The *Devices and Printers* utility lets us look at all #peripheral devices and printers. This interface is very simple and is depicted graphically, allowing access to the properties and configurations of these devices.

#### Program and Features

The *Program and Features* #applet lets you manage installed applications.  You can see a detailed **list of the size and versions of the programs on your computer.**  This is also a place for **uninstalling applications** and managing the many features of #Windows.

#### Network and Sharing

The *Network and Sharing Center* enables the **management of your network adapters, network configurations, and network addressing.** Here you may add a new device, or manage and remove adapters from your local network.

#### System

The *System* applet yields information about the device we are using. **Performance configurations and the interface for backups and system restoration** can also be found in the System #applet. *Remote Desktop* is also managed in this interface.

#### Windows Defender Firewall

*Windows Defender Firewall* is a protective application that monitors your internet connection and scans for malicious software installed on your system.  This firewall is integrated into Windows and runs as soon as you start your computer, defending you from attackers looking to penetrate your system.  This #firewall defends against #malware.

#### Mail

The *Mail* applet appears to be an outdated program – it is a lingering piece from older operating systems.  This will not appear in the *Control Panel* app list unless you have installed a #mail client like Microsoft #Outlook.  From the account settings page, you should be able to see all emails associated with the #network.  This app lets you access the configuration settings for your mail.

#### Sound

The *Sound* applet is used to manage sound devices, as well as sound input and output.  You can monitor the levels for your microphone and speakers and change to different devices from this interface.

#### User Accounts

The *User Accounts* app displays the local user accounts of your home system, or an **extensive list of local accounts** if you are coming from a system administrator role.  It will **list the account names and types, with options to change passwords, profile pictures, and certificate information.**

#### Device Manager

*Device Manager* is used to manage #hardware connected to your device and its #drivers.  If you are experiencing issues with hardware, this is likely where you will begin troubleshooting as it will **provide instant feedback about any of the hardware you are using.**

#### Indexing Options

The *Indexing Options* #applet lets you set strict rules for searching your **system, browser history, and user folders.**  You can change settings so that when you search via Windows, certain folders will be excluded from the search results.  This is a tool used to gain more **efficient searching methods.**

#### File Explorer Options

*File Explorer Options* have settings for **how windows position on the screen, how folders expand, how indexes are implemented,** and much more.  You can **view hidden files, hide extensions, disable search indexes,** and even search within a non-indexed area.

#### Administrative Tools

The *Administrative Tools* #utility is used by the #sysadmin to **manage other accounts on the local network via tools like Event Viewer, Disk Cleanup, Print Management, Resource Monitor, Task Scheduler,** and many more.

#### Power Options

*Power Options* will let you **configure settings related to the power consumption of your devices** and specific actions these devices take when shutting down or restarting.  **Hibernate** configuration is found here with useful options like quickly saving all active data to disk when a laptop screen is closed by the user.  Hibernate is what ‘Fast Startup’ uses to quickly power the system back on. **Sleep, or standby mode, stores all active apps in memory and runs at a low power setting to maintain the operation** of these apps while on standby.  Power plans are available to give you customization of your power usage.

#### Ease of Access Center

*Ease of Access Center* configures setting for **accessibility features like larger cursors, colorblind mode,** and other features that assist people when viewing or listening to media on the computer.
