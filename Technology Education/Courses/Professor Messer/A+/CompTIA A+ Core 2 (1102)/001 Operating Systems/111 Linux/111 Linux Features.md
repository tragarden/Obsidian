# Linux Features 1.11

### Backup

Backing up your data can be done via the ‘ #tar’ command or ‘ #rsync’.  ‘tar’ stands for *‘Tape Archive’* and can be s**cripted / scheduled to run daily to backup your data.** ‘rsync’ will **sync files between the main drive for your system and secondary specified drive.**

### Installers

‘ #apt-get’ and ‘ #yum’ commands are **tools used to update and add #applications** to the system.  There are some graphical software updaters as well in the #Linux ‘App Store’.

### Malware

While there are few viruses or #malware threats for Linux systems, it is still **important to regularly update your system, applications, drivers, and signature database.**  Perform similar practices to safely use other operating systems. 

*Clam Antivirus* is an **opensource virus scanner** that seeks malware in real-time.

The *Shell/Terminal* is used to manage Linux systems and to **run #scripts, configure the operating system and applications, and file management.**

### Sharing

#Samba **facilitates the reading of** *Microsoft Server Message Block* ( #SMB) language for file and print sharing, as well as integrating the *Active Directory.* Using Samba, we can **integrate our Linux devices into a #Windows environment,** and even use a Linux server as a Windows file server.
