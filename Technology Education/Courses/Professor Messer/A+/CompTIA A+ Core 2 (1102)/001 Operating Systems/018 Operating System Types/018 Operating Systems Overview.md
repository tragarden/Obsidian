# Operating System Overview 1.8

### Operating Systems

An *operating system* is a *graphical user interface* ( #GUI) that ***allows us to interact with computer hardware*** in a meaningful way. The #OS **monitors performance and manages hardware to process input and output** of peripherals, as well as **managing the file system and memory. **

### Microsoft 

#### Windows

#Microsoft #Windows is the largest market presence of any operating system manufacturer, which is its biggest advantage providing international support and a wide range of software.  Its popularity is also a disadvantage, as it means that it also has the most #security exploitations.

### Linux

#Linux is a #Unix compatible software system, it is **similar to Unix but it is NOT Unix.**  There are many distributions of Linux that have many intended purposes, meaning that **there is a version of Linux for almost any hardware setup.**  It is ***open source and free*** with a very active community of users that contribute to its open-source development. Its biggest disadvantage is a **lack of driver support for devices like laptops. **

### Google

#### Android 

#Google #Android operating system is based on #Linux and **open source,** has widespread support, and is part of the *Open Handset Alliance* ( #OHA).  To develop apps, you will use the **Android Software Development Kit.**

#### Chrome OS

#Chrome OS by Google is based on the Linux #kernel and its framework is built around the *Google Chrome Web Browser* as **most of the OS apps are cloud based.** It is supported by many manufacturers and is less expensive in general. 

### Mac

#Mac OS is the standard for #Apple products and is known for being **easy to use and having high compatibility with the applications designed for it.** Mac OS also has **less security concerns** than other systems.  Unfortunately using Mac OS requires #proprietary #hardware, which leads to less support and higher costs for less performance.

#### iPad OS

Apple #iPad OS is designed for tablets and is a variant of #iPhone #iOS.  It features a browser called #Safari, a casting app called Sidecar, and support for peripherals.

#### iOS

iOS is based on #Unix and was made for the iPhone, and **although is it Unix based – it is NOT open-source,** and you cannot view the source code as it is proprietary to Apple.  Apps must be built with a *Software Development Kit* ( #SDK) from Apple and approved by Apple before it can be seen in the app store.
