# File Systems 1.8

### Installing the File System

To install a *file system*, you must create a #partition within the #storage drive of your device, and then #format **(erase and encode) the drive** and choose a format type to write the file system with.  Most operating systems can read and write in multiple types of file systems.

### File Allocation Table

*File Allocation Table* ( #FAT) is **one of the oldest file systems** for PC, dating back to 1980.  #FAT32 can maintain **2TB volumes and a maximum file size of 4GB.**

*Extended File Allocation Table* ( #exFAT) is **used for flash drives and can accommodate files of a much greater size.** This is also a **cross-platform format,** working on #Windows, #Mac, and #Linux.

### NTFS

*NT File System* ( #NTFS) is vastly improved from the FAT32 system and **allows for #encryption, compression, symbol-based links, larger files, #security, quotas, and the ability to recover data.**  It has limited compatibility across other operating systems, most can read the files by many cannot write them. 

### Linux

#ext3 / #ext4 are the third and fourth **file systems for Linux** #OS. 

### macOS

*Apple File System* ( #APFS) was added to #macOS via patch High Sierra (10.12.4) and was **optimized for solid-state drives, focusing on encryption and data integrity.**
