# Installing Applications 1.7

#Applications are used to **extend the functions of your operating system and provide tools and solutions** for uses outside of the scope of the #OS.

When installing apps, you need to note what type of #processor and OS you are using: **32-bit or 64-bit.** All versions of applications and #hardware #drivers must match the processor. 64-bit processors are backwards compatible with 32-bit operating systems, meaning that you can run 32-bit apps on a 64-bit system.

*Integrated graphics cards* have the #CPU and #GPU within the same chip and are common in laptops, meeting basic graphical processing needs.

#Dedicated or #Discrete graphics cards are separate from the CPU and have their own #Video #RAM ( #VRAM).

*External Hardware Tokens* can be thought of as **a key for software.**  Usually in the form of a #USB drive, this drive must be inserted into your device in order to unlock certain #software applications, often this is only done for very expensive software. 

Distribution methods are simply ways to get software onto a device: USB drives and app stores.

#ISO files are used to **simulate an optical disk image** that would traditionally be read by an optical drive.  This image is **mounted to our OS and appears as a drive.** This ISO image is a copy of each sector of data that is on an optical disc using the *9660 file system* created by the *International Organization for Standardization* ( #IOS).  The IOS is where the name ISO comes from. 

When installing applications, you need to be considerate of a few things.  After installation, you will **grant the application certain permissions and rights that the system users or admins have.**  Giving permissions to an outside party can cause major issues for you or a business.

When upgrading apps, sometimes this can cause the app to no longer function as intended and you will have to downgrade the update to a previous version that was known to work.

Apps can slow down your system and startup, delete files, access your internal services, as well as your file shares. They can also slow down the productivity of employees if they need to be retrained after an update is implemented.  Sometimes updates can cause significant downtimes and outages that may affect a time sensitive project.
