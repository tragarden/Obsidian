# Upgrading Windows 1.9

### Upgrading

*Upgrading* is useful because it **allows us to retain all files, user accounts, and configurations while advancing the state of our OS** to a more modern variant.  This is very useful when you need to upgrade an #OS on many devices.  This is also known as an *in-place upgrade.*

Plan for your installation – you will need to have a **bootable media, partition configuration, license keys, and #drivers.**

*Hardware Compatibility Check* should be run before an upgrade – this will also run #Windows 10 Upgrade Checker and PC Health Check for Windows 11.

*Windows Life Cycle* or the *‘Modern Life Cycle’* has monthly updates to quality, annual feature updates, and consistent support throughout the life of the platform.
