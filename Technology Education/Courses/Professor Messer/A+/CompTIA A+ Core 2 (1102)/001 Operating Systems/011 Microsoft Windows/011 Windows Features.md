# Windows Features 1.1

### Support

#Windows has support built-in that **allows you to connect with thousands of devices** via large-scale support solutions while maintaining security across your local network. There is also software that **allows for remote caching**. 

### Features

#### Active Directory

*Active Directory Domain Services* is a large #database for your network **collecting data about your computers and some devices** like printers.  This allows you to **use a single console to manage all devices and their security protocols** on the #network.  Active Directory servers depend on a large infrastructure, meaning that it is **not used in the home** environment – only large office spaces or campuses.

#### Workgroups

Windows #Workgroups **link groups of network devices that are not controlled by a single console**, but rather each device has a standalone system with their own passwords and admins, seeing all other devices as peers on the network. 

#### Windows Domain

Windows #Domain is a #centralized #database that allows users to **access devices with their unique credentials,** giving them access to potentially hundreds of thousands of devices.

**Work style desktops allow for a limited amount of customization** in order to streamline repairs done by system administrators, keeping all company devices relatively uniform and accessible to a technician.  The home style allows for full customization of your desktop environment.

#### Remote Desktop

*Remote Desktop Protocol* ( #RDP) sends a request from an RDP client to access another computer’s operating system.  The **client connects from Remote Desktop Service**, which provides access for the client in the Pro and Enterprise editions of Windows.

#### File System

*Encrypting File System* ( #EFS) **encrypts individual files and folders** and is a #utility of the #NTFS file system. 

#### BitLocker

#BitLocker is a *Full Disk Encryption* ( #FDE) technology that **encrypts everything on your drive including the operating system**.

#### Group Policy

*Group Policy Editor* allows an **administrator to centrally manage all users and systems** within the active directory or local system.

*Local Group Policy* is used to **manage your local device via gpedit.msc.**

*Group Policy Management Console* works in conjunction with Active Directory to **manage many devices at once via gpmc.msc.**
