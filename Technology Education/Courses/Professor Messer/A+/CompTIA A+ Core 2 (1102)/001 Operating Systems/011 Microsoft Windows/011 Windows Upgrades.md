# Windows Upgrades 1.1

### Windows Upgrade

#Windows Upgrade is advantageous because it **allows us to keep all our files and some preferences and configurations while switching multiple users to a newer version** of Windows.  Upgrades save us the time of reinstalling and reconfiguring windows on each device.  Any other installation of a window’s #OS will effectively remove all user data for configuration and files.

**In-place upgrades retain all apps, documents, and settings** while using the existing OS to upgrade to a new OS. 

*Clean Installs* **use bootable media** and mean that **you will need to back up all your data,** as the configuration and files will not be saved once the new OS is loaded from your designated #boot drive.

You can **download the 32-bit or 64-bit OS** you need from #Microsoft, which includes a **media creation tool.**  Make sure you ***select the correct bit rating*** for your system.

**Note your upgrade pathing** before attempting this.  You will likely need to update from the specific version you are using to the corresponding version of the update.  Please note that you cannot update to windows 10 from windows 8.0 – you will need to update to 8.1 before this is possible.

*Post-installation checks* should include **checking for proper booting, testing for unknown hardware configurations, and using Start > Settings > System > Recovery > Go Back to return to the previous version** if things aren’t working correctly.

After installing, check for updates to *Service Packs, security patches, security apps, drivers, and applications.*
