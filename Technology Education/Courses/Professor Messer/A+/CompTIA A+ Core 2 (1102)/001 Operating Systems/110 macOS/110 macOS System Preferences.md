The #Network menu allows you to **configure wired and wireless connections, #IPv4 and #IPv6 settings, and granular network settings** for #IP, #DNS, #DHCP, 802.1x, and other networks.

#### Printers and Scanners

The *Printers and Scanners* option manages these devices and their settings. This menu can show you detailed information about your printer including ink and toner levels depicted visually.  You can see things like your scanning status, and right and permissions related to sharing printing devices.

#### Security and Privacy

The *Security and Privacy* menu **manages application access to your data.**  You can toggle or limit location services, photo access, calendar information, camera and microphone access, and other private data like files and folders.
