# macOS Features 1.10

### Features

#### Mission Control

*Mission Control* allows you to **manage the array of windows** that are open on your desktop, changing their position and visibility.  This is accessed via **Control-UP or by swiping up with three fingers.**

#### Spaces

*Spaces* **manages multiple Mission Control layouts across multiple logical desktops,** allowing for multiple configurations at a quick glance.

#### Keychain

*Keychain* is an **encrypted password management utility** that secures your passwords, notes, certificates, and other #security codes in a **cloud-based folder that is associated with your #Apple ID** login credentials.  This #encryption utility is integrated into all #Apple devices.

#### Spotlight

*Spotlight* is a *built-in search engine for* #macOS, which is similar to Windows search. This will **retrieve files, apps, images, and more from your system data.**  You can find Spotlight in the upper right corner of most windows, indicated by a magnifying glass, or you can press **Command-Space.**  You can toggle search categories via System Preferences / Spotlight, then Enable/disable categories.

#### iCloud

#iCloud is **how Apple devices synchronize their data across multiple platforms and technologies.**  You can share all of your data, including calendars, photos, files, contacts, music, and configuration settings.  This is how all of your #iOS devices are backed up.

#### Gestures

*Gestures* can be **performed if you have a trackpad** for your Apple device. **Gestures utilize one, two, or three fingers and can recognize swiping, pinching, and clicking.**  These can be managed under **System Preferences / Trackpad.**

#### Finder

*Finder* is the main **file management interface for iOS,** letting you create, delete, rename, and launch files.  This window is where you will see other devices you are able to access, such as remote viewing clients and file servers.

#### Remote Disk

*Remote Disk* can be managed in the System Preferences and is used to **remotely access ROM data from an optical drive** on a remote device. It is designed for copying files and **does not work well with video or audio data** on these ROMs.

#### The Dock

The *Dock* is similar to the Windows Toolbar – it is located at the bottom of the display and **holds a set of shortcuts for commonly used programs.** Any programs that are actively running will have a small dot under their icon.  **Auto-hide and positioning can be managed within System Preferences.**

#### Disk Utility

*Disk Utility* is used to **manage drives and related images, as well as verify and repair file systems and partitions.**  Drive formatting and restoration utilities fall under this domain. 

#### FileVault

*FileVault* is the standard *Full Disk Encryption* ( #FDE) for #macOS which uses your #iCloud **authentication credentials as a local decryption key.**  You can find this within **System Preferences > Security & Privacy > FileVault.**

#### Terminal

*Terminal* gives us access to the *command line interface* ( #CLI) so that we can control the #OS without a #GUI.  From the #terminal we can run #scripts, configure the OS, and manage files and application settings.

#### Force Quit

*Force Quit* is used to **stop an application** and the interface for this can be opened with **Command-Option-Escape** and then setting your application to ‘quit’.  Alternatively, you can **hold the Option key and right click the app in the Dock,** then choose Force Quit.
