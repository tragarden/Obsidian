# Microsoft Management Console 1.3

### MMC

‘ #mmc.exe’ will launch the *management console*, alternatively this can be done by searching through windows for the application. This will bring up a blank tab – you are in total control of this console and must **build it to your preferences by adding the screens you wish to see.**  When you populate the console, you will see several utilities running within this user interface.  This allows you to **configure the user interface to only include the tools you use.**  

All the utilities below can be added as a #snap-in for #Windows *Management Console.*

### Utilities

#### Event Viewer

*Event Viewer* provides #centralized **event logging for applications, security, setup, and system information, warnings, critical, errors, and both successful and failed audits.**  This can be run in isolation by using #eventvwr.msc.

#### Disk Management

*Disk Management* #utility can be run in isolation by using #diskmgmt.msc.  ***ALWAYS BACK UP DATA BEFORE USING THIS INTERFACE – YOU CAN LOSE DATA WHEN MANAGING YOUR DISKS.***

#### Task Scheduler

*Task Scheduler* allows you to **schedule processes, applications, or scripts** to operate at specific times and specific amounts of time.  It will provide some basic scheduling for you so you can set a schedule with one click.  You can start this utility with #taskschd.msc.

#### Device Manager

*Device Manager* is the interface used when installing new #hardware or updating #drivers for existing hardware.  Device drivers must match your operating system version and the bits your system is tuned for.  Use #devmgmt.msc to run device manager in isolation.

#### Certificate Manager

*Certificate Manager* is used to view #digital #certificates stored within the operating system, run via #certmgr.msc.  This interface allows you to view many, many types of certificates including personal, enterprise, trusted publishers, and many more.

#### Users and Groups

*Local Users and Groups* will **list all the users on the device from Administrators to Guests.** The #administrator is the #Windows #super-user.  The guest login has limited access and does not require #credentials to use. All other users are ‘Regular’ users, and their #privileges and rights are determined by the Administrator of the local group. Groups can be created to provide privileges and access to a certain list of users. **Common groups include Administrators, Backup Operators, Event Log Readers, Remote Desktop Users,** and any other groups you are creative enough to create. #lusrmgr.msc will allow you to run this utility in isolation.

#### Performance Monitor

*Performance Monitor* can be run via #perfmon.msc and is used to **gather long-term statistics about operating system metrics.** This interface **allows you to automate alerts and actions based on the statistics** collected by the monitor that may indicate a problem or change in the local devices. There is a built-in reporting feature that analyzes long-term trends and assesses them for any issues.

#### Group Policy

*Group Policy Editor* uses the *Active Directory* central #database of user information, or a local system.  From this interface you can change network, security, and user settings for other devices on the network. #Gpedit.msc or #gpmc.msc will run this program in isolation, depending on what system you are running.
