# Windows Tools 1.3

### Common Tools

#### System Information

System Information is run via #msinfo32.exe and will provide you with a **list of #hardware resources** such as #memory, #DMA, #IRQ, and system conflicts. Within this interface is a thorough **list of components related to multimedia devices and peripherals, display information, inputs, and network information.**  Under the *Software Environment* tab, you will find a **list of all drivers, all print jobs, and a list of running tasks.**

#### Resource Monitor

*Resource Monitor* gives you detailed **information in real-time about the performance of devices** in our computer.  This will include an **overview of total usage, processor usage, memory usage, disk usage, and network usage.** It can be initialized via #resmon.exe.

#### System Configuration

*System Configuration* #utility will **manage the #boot #processes of the system, #startup settings, and #services** that run when the computer boots.  You can start your system in **safe mode** from this interface, as well as **configure log settings for capturing data.** This can be accessed via #msconfig.exe.

#### Disk Cleanup

*Disk Cleanup* #utility shows us how much #storage space is being consumed by different categories of files. #Cleanmgr.exe will open this utility.

##### Defragmentation

‘ #defrag’ refers to disk #defragmentation, which means that **files are reorganized to be contiguous, improving reading and writing times.**  This means that defrag takes pieces of information that is scattered across the physical space of your hard drive and moves related pieces of data closer together.  Defragmentation is NOT necessary if you are using a solid-state drive.  By selecting the **‘Optimize’** option, we can get a graphical depiction of what this looks like as the drive is defragmented. 

#### Optimization

The Optimize Drives window will allow you to see the state of the drive and give you the option of analyzing its contents or further optimizing the drive.  #Optimization is often scheduled by #windows automatically, and you can see this at the bottom of this window.

#### Windows Registry

The *Windows Registry Editor* is a large #database with a hierarchical structure used to store information about windows and all of its applications.  Using #regedit.exe, we are able to see information about the #kernel of Windows we are using, #drivers and #services that are running on the system, *Security Account Manager* ( #SAM), the user interface, and all applications. ***BACKUP YOUR REGISTRY BEFORE YOU MAKE ANY CHANGES VIA REGEDIT.  THIS IS A BUILT IN FUNCTION OF REGEDIT- FOR A REASON! – USE IT!***
