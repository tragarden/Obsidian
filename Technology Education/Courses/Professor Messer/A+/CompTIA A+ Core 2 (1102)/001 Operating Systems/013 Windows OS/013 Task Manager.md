# Task Manager 1.3

*Task Manager* yields **real-time system statistics** like #CPU usage, #memory usage, disk access, #network usage, #power consumption, and many more metrics.

Start the Task Manager with **Ctrl-Alt-Del, Ctrl-Shift-Esc,** or by right-clicking the Task Bar and selecting Task Manager.

### Tabs within Task Manager

#### Services

The #Services tab **shows non-interactive applications and background #processes that do not have a user interface or configuration settings.** All management of services is done from this tab – your only options will be **start, stop, and reset.**  This is useful when something isn’t working, you can stop the service and restart it hoping that this will correct any problems with its operation.

#### Startup

The #Startup Tab **lists all the applications that are configured to start when Windows boots.**  It will tell you the impact each application will have on startup, and these apps can be added to or removed from the startup queue via this tab.  This is useful for troubleshooting a slow system start – you can add or remove applications from the startup list to identify ones that are problematic and slow your computer down. 

#### Processes

The #Processes tab **lists all your running applications and provides information about the resources they are actively consuming.** It allows you to sort and filter processes by many different metrics.

#### Performance

The Performance tab will show you **real-time data related to different hardware** on your computer. This will show data for processor usage, #RAM usage, disk usage, and network data usage. 

#### Network

The #Network tab has been rolled into the Performance tab on modern iterations of Windows. The Network information provided includes **utilization, link speeds, and the connection state** of your interface.

#### Users

The #Users tab will show all users within your local network and the applications they are actively running. From here you can disconnect users from the local network and manage their accounts as an #administrator.
