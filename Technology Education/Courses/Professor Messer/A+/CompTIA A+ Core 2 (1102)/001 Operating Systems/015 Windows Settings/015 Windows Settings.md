# Windows Settings 1.5

### Settings Menu

The *settings menu* is found in the #Windows menu and is commonly used to configure #GUI settings in a more modern interface than what is provided by *Control Panel.*

#### Time and Language

*Time and Language* settings are found within Windows’ Settings.  Windows will automatically set the time based on time servers from the internet or within your local network. This time will need to be within a tolerance of 5 minutes in order to work with *Active Domain* which is highly sensitive to synchronized clocks.

#### Update and Security

*Update and Security* keeps your #OS updated with needed #security patches and bug fixes. You can **toggle automatic updates** so that they are manually queued if that is your preference. You can also **set ‘Active Hours’** where Windows will be prohibited from updating, such as while you are actively working. 

#### Personalization

*Personalization* options may be disabled if you are using a work computer, but most units have access to these settings.

#### Apps 

The *Apps* utility manages applications on our device so that we can **add, remove, or otherwise modify our installed applications.**  In this same window we are also able to manage Windows features like preferred fonts, what OpenSSH ( #SSH) server we prefer, or support for #SNMP.

#### Privacy

The *Privacy* option allows you to **customize your advertisement targeting,** requesting ads that are in a different language or different topic.  You can toggle ‘suggested content’ on and off as well as app launch analysis.  You can enable or disable whether third parties are able to access your voice recordings from speech recognition apps.

#### System

The *System* options lets you change #display, #audio, and notification settings. You can manage your **night light, scaling, screen resolution, audio inputs and outputs,** and toggle notifications on the lock screen. 

#### Devices

The *Devices* option lets us manage #Bluetooth, printers, mouse, keyboard, and other #peripheral settings.

#### Network

*Network and Internet* will show up current #network settings and the strength of our connection.  You may also change #IP settings and address information from this window. 

#### Gaming

The *Gaming* tab connects you to the Xbox gaming network via the Xbox Game Bar which allows you to chat with friends and join their game

#### Accounts

The *Accounts* tab lets us manage both #Microsoft and local accounts, #email settings and apps, and sign-in options like #PIN entry or requirement of a #security key.
