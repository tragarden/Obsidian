# Firewall Configuration 1.6

### Windows Defender Firewall

All modern versions of the #Windows #OS will have *Windows Defender Firewall* as a built-in #utility that automatically runs when you start your system.  Your #firewall will **always be on and active** unless you are troubleshooting or managing your #network.

#### Disabling

You can disable the firewall by running as #administrator in the firewall menus.  You can set different firewall configurations for different locations, similar to the *Network Locations* feature.  You can even choose to block any notifications and incoming connections including previously approved devices.

#### Settings

More granular settings for the firewall include **port blocking, predefined exceptions, and custom rules** for every app.  You can set apps to only run on a private / public network from this interface.

*Advanced Settings* for the firewall let you **configure inbound and outbound rule, connection security rules, and network monitoring.**

When *Inbound Rules* is right clicked, we have the option of adding new rules allowing for granular control over each app.
