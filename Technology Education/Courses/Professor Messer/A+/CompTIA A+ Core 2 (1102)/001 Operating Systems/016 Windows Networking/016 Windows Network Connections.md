# Windows Network Connections

### Network Setup

#Network setup is managed in the *Network and Sharing Center* found within the *Control Panel,* featuring a setup wizard supporting many different connection types.  You will select what kind of connection this is – general internet connection, new home network, or workplace network. 

Often when connecting to a corporate network, you will do so via #VPN Concentrator devices that #encrypt all the data requests and responses entering and exiting the corporate network. 

#### VPN

#Microsoft has a built-in #VPN client that is included with all copies of #Windows.  You provide a name for the connections and a #URL that links to the VPN concentrator and windows facilitates the connection. 

*Smart Cards* are used to establish a connection to the VPN concentrator **without submitting typed credentials** into the designated boxes.

#### SSID

*Service Set Identification* ( #SSID) is also **known as the network name** and will be used to identify a network when connecting.

#### Security

#Security type, such as #WPA2, is the type of security the network is using. 

#Encryption type is self-explanatory.

A *Security Key* is the last step needed when connecting to the network and validates your access.

#### WWAN

*Wireless Wide-Area Network* ( #WWAN) is built-in mobile connectivity that uses a #USB #antenna to connect to a #cellular network.  This is sometimes called a #tether or a #hotspot and requires third-party software.
