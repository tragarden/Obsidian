# Windows IP Configuration 1.6

### DHCP

#DHCP will **automatically assign your device an #IP address** by default when first establishing connection to a network.  In the case that the **DHCP is unavailable, APIPA is used.**  DHCP server systems have redundancy so there will hopefully always be a server available to assign your IP address.

### APIPA

#APIPA does not provide a static IP address or connect to the DHCP server.  It has **limited functionality and can only be used to communicate locally** by assigning an address between 169.254.1.0 and 169.254.254.255 – this is known as a #link-local address.

### Static IP

#Static addressing is usually only used in the case of connecting to a #network that requires manual IP address parameters.

IP addresses are unique identifiers that may be automatically assigned by a DHCP server.

*Domain Name Services* ( #DNS) translates between #URL and IP addresses.

#Loopback address lets you ping your own IP stack via the IP 127.0.0.1
