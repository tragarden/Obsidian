# CIA Triad

The CIA Triad represents a set of principles fundamental to security. Occasionally this is known as the AIC triad to differentiate it from the government organization CIA.

### Confidentiality

Prevent the disclosure of information to unauthorized individuals or devices. In other words, this means ensuring that certain information is only accessible by certain people.

Methods for ensuring confidentiality include:

- Encryption - the encoding and decoding of data so that it cannot be read if intercepted or accessed by unauthorized individuals.

- Access Controls - selectively restricting access to resources.

- Multi-factor Authentication - multiple measures taken to authorize a user.

#### Integrity

Data cannot be modified without detection allowing data to be transferred and stored as intended and without modification. 

Methods for ensuring integrity include:

- Hashing - mapping data of any given length to a value of fixed length.

- Digital Signatures - verifying the integrity of data via mathematical schemes. This is done by hashing the data and then encrypting the hash with an asymmetric encryption algorithm. We can thus verify the sender and that the data is unchanged.

- Certificates - added to digital signatures to add more verification for integrity of data.

- Non-Repudiation - proof of integrity that ensures the data is genuine.

#### Availability

Systems and networks are up and running for authorized users at all times or as much as possible. 

Methods for ensuring availability include:

- Redundancy - having multiple iterations of existing systems or backups for data to make sure they are always available even in the event of hardware or software failure.

- Fault Tolerance - systems continue to run even when a failure occurs.

- Patching - closing gaps in security by updating systems, software, and devices regularly.
