# AA and A

The AAA Framework refers to the process of Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting.

Identification is who you claim to be and is typically represented by a username.

Authentication is the means to prove your identity via passwords and other authentication methods.

Authorization occurs after you are authenticated and determines the level of access that you will be granted.

Accounting refers to logs, login data, sent and received data, and logout information.

### Systems

When systems need to authenticate, they are unable to submit their own password. You may be responsible for remotely authenticating many devices throughout a workday. 

To authenticate devices, a system of digitally signed certificates is used to access VPNs and internal networks. Management software provided by the organization can authenticate the device via certificates.

### Certificate Authority

A Certificate Authority ( #CA) is an organization that issues certificates for devices. Many organizations maintain their own CA. The CA creates a certificate for the device and digitally signs it so it can be used as an authentication factor. The digital signature of the CA is used to validate the certificate.

### Authorization Models

After authenticating a user or device, the level of authorization is applied to determine the range of access this entity should have. Assigning each individual device or user access rights is a time consuming process with a lot of room for human error.

Using an authorization model means creating groups, roles, organizations, and attributes that can be assigned to users so their account can inherit privileges from an overarching parent entity.

These groups are known as abstractions and they reduce the complexity of assigning user rights. The also create a clear relationship between the user and the resource - instead of knowing every right of every user, you can learn the rights of the groups of users instead. Then if access rights change for the group, you could potentially change the rights of hundreds of users simultaneously.
