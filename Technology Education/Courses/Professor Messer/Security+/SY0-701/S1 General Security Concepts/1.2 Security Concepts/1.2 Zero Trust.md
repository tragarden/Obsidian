# Zero Trust

In many cases, if you are able to gain access beyond the firewall of an organization there aren't many effective security controls. The concept of zero trust refers to applying security controls to every aspect within an organization network - every device, every process, and every person. 

Everything must be verified within a zero trust environment. Multi-factor Authentication, encryption, permissions, access control, additional firewalls, monitoring, and analytics will be applied to all devices and communications.

### Functional Planes 

A strategy for evaluating the security of the organization is to break down the infrastructure into various functional planes. There are physical, virtual, and cloud components to consider when evaluating the security posture of the network.

You can think of these planes as a Data Plane and a Control Plane. When looking at this in terms of a network switch, the faceplate with female receptors for plugs would be the Data plane and the logic inside the device would be the control plane.

#### Data Plane

The Data Plane refers to the network and it's transmissions. This means all transmitted frames, packets, and data that is being processed, forwarded, trunked, encrypted, and network address translation ( #NAT). All devices that perform these communications fall under this category as well.

#### Control Plane

The Control Plane refers to the controls in place to manage the actions described in the Data Plane. This means defining policies and rules like how packet forwarding is managed, as well as rules applying to routing tables, firewalls, session tables, and NAT tables.

### Controls

In order to control trust within the network we should observe certain practices.

#### Adaptive Identity

Adaptive Identity refers to who is accessing resources and what risks they pose when they do so. This would mean considering the source of a request - what is their role within or relationship to the organization. 

Risks should be considered such as:

- What is their relationship to the organization?
- What is their physical location?
- What type of connection are they using?
- What is their IP address?

Once the scope of risk is established, authentication should always be reinforced if possible.

#### Threat Scope Reduction

Threat Scope Reduction refers to decreasing the amount of possible access and entry points within a network. Limiting access to resources reduces the attack surface and makes things more difficult for threat actors.

#### Policy Driven Access Control

Access controls combine the concept of Adaptive Identity with a set of established rules. This is an extension of authorization ensuring that whoever wants to access resources on the network is verified. 

### Security Zones

Security Zones refer to where a user or device is connecting from, extending beyond a one-to-one connection and analyzing the overview of the total path of the connection and the devices involved along the way.

Determining whether a connection is trusted, internal or external, via #VPN, and what department of the organization is requesting resources are all considerations that need to be made. Once you know this information, you can set rules about which zones may access other zones.

An example of rules that could be implemented include blocking an Untrusted user from accessing Trusted zones, or an Untrusted user accessing the internal network.

### Policy Enforcement Point

A Policy Enforcement Point ( #PEP) is placed within the network and evaluates all connections from users and systems that request access to resources. 

Subjects and systems refer to the entities that attempt to access network resources, like users, applications, and non-human entities. The PEP acts as a gatekeeper that verifies the identity of any given entity requesting access.

### Policy Decision Point

The Policy Enforcement Point does not decide authentication - this is the responsibility of the Policy Decision Point ( #PCD). The PCD makes the authentication decision and is usually composed of a set of policies and a policy administrator. 

#### Policy Engine

The Policy Engine evaluates every access decision based on established policies before granting, denying, or revoking access.

#### Policy Administrator

The Policy Admin communicates with the PEP to generate access tokens or credentials and informs the PEP when to allow or disallow access for an entity.
