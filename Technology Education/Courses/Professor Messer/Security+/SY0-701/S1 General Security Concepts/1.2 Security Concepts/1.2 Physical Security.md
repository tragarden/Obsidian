# Physical Security

Physical security refers to structures that are implemented to limit access.

### Barricades

Barriers, bollards, and sometimes moats can be used to prevent people from accessing certain areas or prevent cars from entering these areas.

### Vestibules

Access Control Vestibules are entryways or corridors that prevent people from freely passing through an area. This works like an air lock on a space craft - usually all doors are locked and sealed except for the door currently being accessed. Sometimes it will function with one door being locked and the other open. Opening one door typically causes all other doors to lock.

### Fencing

Fences have obvious implementation for security measures. They might be see through, opaque, or reinforced with deterrents like barbed wire.

### Cameras

Closed Circuit Television ( #CCTV) is an increasingly common security control that might have motion recognition or object identification like face and license plate scanners. These operate on a network that interlinks all the cameras to one system.

### Guards

Guards often work in pairs to ensure integrity by making sure a single person doesn't have full access to physical assets. Guards offer physical protection and offer services of validation for incoming employees and visitors.

### Access Badges

Access badges are informational badges about the entrant and often use #RFID for electronic logging and authentication.

### Lighting

Lighting that can illuminate areas of the building deter and identify attackers and allow non-IR cameras to capture images better. Angles, shadows, and glare are all factors that need to be considered when implementing lighting. 

### Sensors

There are a variety of sensors used in physical security. Types of sensors include:

- Infrared - detects light in well lit and dark areas, used for motion detection.
- Pressure - detects changes in force and can monitor floors and windows.
- Microwave - detects movement across wide areas.
- Ultrasonic - Sends signals and receives reflected sound waves to detect motion and collisions.
