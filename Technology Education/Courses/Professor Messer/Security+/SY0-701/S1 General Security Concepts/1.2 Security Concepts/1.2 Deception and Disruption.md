# Deception and Disruption

Deception and Disruption refers to methods that the organization's internal members can use against threat agents.

### Honeypots

A honeypot is a trap that attracts threat actors so that you are able to observe their attack methods and analyze them. These are virtualized systems that slow down threat actors as they determine the validity of the target system and allow organization members to act before damage is done.

### Honeynets

Honeynets are the environment that contain honeypots, since rarely is there a single device within a network. The honeynet contains a virtualized network containing servers, workstations, routers, switches, and firewalls that deceive a threat actor into believing they are within a real network. 

### Honeyfiles

Honeyfiles are files that contain fake information that might be appealing to threat actors. These often have bait titles like 'passwords.txt' that an attacker would be drawn to or deterred by if they feel it's suspicious. If the file is access, alerts are made to administrators.

### Honeytokens

Honeytokens are traceable data on the honeynet that tracks any user that steals it. An example of this is placing #API credentials on a public share for cloud services that are not actually usable, but when accessed the user will be tracked. Fake email addresses are often used as well, although any type of data could be used like database records or site cookies.
