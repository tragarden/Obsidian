# Gap Analysis

Gap Analysis refers to the comparison of where we are versus where we want to be. While this is simply explained, it is complicated to execute and may require much technical research, data gathering, and extensive consideration.

Gap analysis is evaluated in comparison to a baseline established by the organization or regulatory agencies. Some regulation to consider in these cases include the NSIT Special Publication 800-171 and the ISO/IEC 27001.

### People and Processes

Considering the established procedures and employees is important information to consider when establishing baselines.

When considering employees, you need to note their level of formal experience, current training status, and their understanding of procedures and policies related to security.

When considering processes you must research the IT systems established within the organization as well as the security policies already implemented.

### Comparison

You will want to evaluate all currently implemented systems and identify their weaknesses and which processes are already effective. Each security category will need to be evaluated and examined granularly.

The NIST SP 800-53 is a useful document for providing guidelines about performing these evaluations. It will break each category down into smaller pieces to help you understand each specific component within an organization. 

### Analysis and Report

You will include the people, processes, baselines, and comparisons in your report. Additionally you will need to identify the path the organization will take in order to meet their goals, and what amount of time, money, and change controls will be required. Recommendations for meeting expectations and estimates about the amount of time and money are recorded in the analysis and report.

We can use a chart like the following one to identify security requirements for each area of an organization:
