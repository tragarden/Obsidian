# Non-Repudiation

The concept of non-repudiation means not being able to deny what has been said or sent. This concept is exemplified in the practice of signing a contract: if we have signed something, a third party could state with reasonable certainty that we agreed to the policy and signed it. 

Non-repudiation is proof of integrity or origin with a high assurance of authenticity.

### Proof of Integrity

Proof of integrity ensures that data has not changed and that it has remained accurate and consistent during transfer.

In cryptography, hashes are used to represent data as a string of text that serves as a fingerprint of the data that can be later compared by the receiver to see if integrity was maintained during transfer.

- If the data changes, the hash value will change, indicating modification during transfer.
- Hashing does not allow us to verify who sent the data, only that integrity was maintained.

### Proof of Origin

Proof of Origin refers to proof of the source of the message via authentication. We are able to ensure that a signature is not faked. 

This is done via asymmetric encryption using both a private and public key. Only authenticated users may possess the private key, and this is used to ensure the validity of the public key attached to the file that is transferred. Any change in the message will invalidate the signature associated with it.

This is often applied by simply clicking 'Add Digital Signature', although the backend of this process is more complicated.

The process is illustrated below:

The sender sends the file:

>Plaintext file > Hashing Algorithm > Hash of Plaintext > Private Key > Digital Signature > Plaintext and Digital Signature

The receiver receives the file:

>Receives public key + digital signature > plain text file goes through hashing > two values are compared 

The sender and receiver both send the file they possess through the hashing algorithm, and if both hashes match, the integrity of the file is guaranteed.
