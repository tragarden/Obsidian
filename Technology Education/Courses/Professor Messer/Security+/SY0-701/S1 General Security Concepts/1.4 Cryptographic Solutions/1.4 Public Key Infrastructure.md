# Public Key Infrastructure

Public Key Infrastructure ( #PKI) refers to policies, procedures, hardware, software, and people involved with digital certificates. This infrastructure is responsible for creating, distributing, managing, storing, and revoking privileges related to digital certificates.

### Certificate Authority

This is a major endeavor for even small organizations. A certificate authority ( #CA) is responsible for binding public keys to people or devices.

### Symmetric Encryption

Symmetric Encryption is the practice of using a key to encrypt data and then using the same key to later decrypt this data via a single shared key. A problem with this method is that if the key is obtained by a threat actor, the data is now compromised.

The secret key can be shared between users to unlock the data. Unfortunately, this design does not scale well when the group passes about 10 members - it then becomes very difficult to distribute the keys and keep track of who will need them and when.

It's advantageous to use symmetric encryption because it works very fast and has low overhead. It is often combined with asymmetric encryption methods.

### Asymmetric Encryption

Asymmetric Encryption uses two different keys to encrypt and decrypt data. These are known as public and private keys and they are mathematically related. 

The private key should be kept private and avoid sharing it with multiple sources. The public key is for sharing and you can present it to anyone that needs it. 

Only the private key is able to decrypt data that has been encrypted with the public key. The public key cannot be exploited or cracked to determine the private key.

### Generation

Asymmetric encryption requires the user to perform key generation to build both the public and private keys using mathematical computations like number randomization and large prime number generation. 

Often a password for the private key will also be generated during this phase, which means that in order to use the key, you will additionally need a password even if you possess the key.

### Plain and Ciphertext

The public key is used to encode plaintext information into ciphertext, which is encrypted and can only be decrypted with the private key.

### Key Escrow

Key Escrow refers to a third party possessing your decryption keys. This might be someone within your organization or a contracted contact. Sometimes government agencies will require the decryption key for regulatory purposes.
