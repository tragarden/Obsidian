# Key Exchange

Transferring keys between parties is known as key exchange and poses logistical problems about how to safely get the key to it's target user.

### Out of Band

Out of Band exchange refers to sending the key without using the internet. This could be done over the phone, via courier, or in-person transactions. This is an inconvenient and slow method of key exchange.

### In-Band

In-band key exchange is when keys are transferred over the network, but in a secure way. This might mean that the key is encrypted a second time where the user that receives it decrypts it to retrieve the key that was transmitted. 

### Real-Time

Often it is required that data be sent very quickly while still needing to be secure. A common way of achieving this is for a client to encrypt a symmetric key with a server's public key. The server decrypts this shared key and uses it to encrrypt more data - this is known as a session key. 

Session keys are ephemeral and are often discarded after use or at least frequently on a regular basis. These keys need to be changed often and need to be unpredictable. 

### Key Exchange Algorithms

Key Exchange Algorithms mean that two or more users on a network possess the same private and public key. This means that each party can generate their own encryption with a public key and then all parties can decrypt it with the matching private key. This creates what is known as a symmetric key.
