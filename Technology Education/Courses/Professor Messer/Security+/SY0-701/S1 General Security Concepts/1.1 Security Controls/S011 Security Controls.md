# Security Controls

In cyber security there are a variety of assets that need to be protected like data, physical assets, and systems that run everything.

Security Controls are implemented to prevent security events and reduce their affect. There are four main types of security controls. 

### Technical Controls

Technical controls are implemented via technical systems and may include operating system controls and applications like firewalls and anti-virus software. This could mean implementing policies in the operating systems to allow and disallow different functions.

### Managerial Controls

Administrative controls are policies associated with the design of security systems. You may create documentation about these procedures that become part of the security policies or the standard operating procedures of the organization.

### Operational Controls

Operational controls refer to people instead of hardware or software. This means security guards and awareness programs that inform employees about security risks.

### Physical Controls

Physical Controls refer to devices that restrict physical access of resources. This might mean a guard shack, fences, barricades, locks, and badge readers.

### Control Type Subcategories

Each of the aforementioned categories can be subdivided into the following subcategories.

#### Preventative

Preventative controls refer to things that block access to resources. This might be a configured firewall, a security policy, a guard building that identifies entrants, or door locks on the facility.

#### Deterrent

Deterrent controls refer to things that discourage intrusion attempts. This would include splash screens on applications, a threat of demotion, a front reception desk that is staffed, or posted warning signs throughout the facility.

#### Detective

Detective controls refer to things that identify and log intrusions. This would include collecting and reviewing system logs, reviewing login reports, having staff that patrols the property, or motion detectors that log activity in certain areas.

#### Corrective

Corrective controls refer to controls that are applied after an event has been detected that attempts to remedy or reverse the event with minimal downtime. This would include restoring to a previous backup to recover from malware, implementing policies for reporting incidents, contacting law enforcement for criminal infractions, and fire extinguishers to thwart an active fire on premises.

#### Compensating

Compensating controls refer to alternative measures implemented to manage a situation that is unusual or temporary. This would include a firewall that blocks applications instead of implementing a patch, separation of duties in the member hierarchy, having guards scheduled simultaneously, or having a generator that runs during a power outage.

#### Directive

Directive controls refer to orienting a team member towards security compliance, and this is considered the weakest of the controls. Examples of this include telling members to store sensitive files in a protected folder, creating compliance policies and procedures, training users on the implemented policies, and posting signs only permitting authorized personnel.
