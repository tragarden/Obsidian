# Obsidian

This is mainly my collection of notes related to my technology education.
I typically watch YouTube videos or follow coursework from various sources, 
while taking notes where I try to use my own original language.

Most of this is cited and contains links to the source, or at least
credits the original author. I am constantly updating, and usually the
links, tags, and stylizing are added long after I take the notes when I 
want to review concepts and organize my thoughts better.

This is meant to serve as an extension of the resources I use. I find 
that typing often helps to reinforce ideas in my head rather than just 
reading and moving on. I used to have all of these notes in various Word
files, some as long as 120 pages of walls of text. When I converted my notes
to markdown language and .md files, I thought I would learn markdown and make
them more interactive once I discovered Obsidian.

I hope you find this to be a useful resource!
