# JavaScript Source Code

#JavaScript is the last layer of code implemented into the source code of a website. The supporting structure is composed of #HTML and #CSS. HTML contains the main content of the site like blocks of text, images, links, and skeletal structures that give shape to the page. CSS add styling like colors and font styles. 

Together HTML and CSS can be used to create a static webpage. JavaScript is the component of the code that makes the page dynamic and interactive. It can ad visual and interactive effects that make the experience much more immersive and interesting. 

### HTML

HyperText Markup Language ( #HTML) is within all web pages. We can go to any website in existence and press CTRL + U to view the source code of the page. On a static web page, we will see the HTML that gives structure and content for the page. 

### CSS

Cascading Style Sheets ( #CSS) is a rule-based code that manages the presentation and styling of web pages. It modifies the existing HTML code to beautify and simplify the artistic aspects of a website. 

CSS code will be found internally within the \<style> elements in the HTML code, or imported via .css files that are externally referenced. When externally defined, the file will be parsed using an HTML \<link> element like the following example:

>\<head>
>	\<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
>\</head>

### JavaScript

JavaScript ( #JS) will be found internally and externally within the \<script> elements using raw code or parsed using an external .js file like the following example:

>\<script src="secret.js">\</script>

If you want to see the contents of the .js file, click the link for the file which will show us the script contained within. This script is written in the JavaScript language which will appear abstract and indecipherable to the laymen. This is due to code obfuscation.
