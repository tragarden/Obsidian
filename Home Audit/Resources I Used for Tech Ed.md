All of these materials should be able to be used on any basic computer, nothing fancy needed.  

  

There are a lot of things I have used throughout multiple years to try and learn something that translates to a career. I tried site development for a few months before I realized It's not really the right direction for me (but maybe it is for you). I tried out multiple coding languages, but I never had a purpose for them so I never began implementing them (until recently). I would just learn the basics of the language and go - what now?Â 

  

There are so many things you can learn and so many directions you can go, it was difficult for me to determine what I liked. My best advice is to identify whatever you have general interest in and go with that. It might mean trying 20 different things until you find out which one clicks for you - at least that's how it happened for me.

  

I didn't have a computer for 5 years and when I got one I decided to learn everything from scratch. I went through every possible setting on Windows, googled what I didn't know, and tried to really use my PC like a tool. I was using 3-4 fingers to type at the time. Improving very basic skills like typing and organizing files really changed the way I use computers.  

  

In my experience there are 100s of times that I was so frustrated and downright pissed off that I couldn't get stuff to work or just didn't understand. Enter this journey expecting lots of failure. I have walked away from so many situations feeling like a dumbass and solved my problems with ease when I return at a later time. Some of this is HARD and CONFUSING.  

  

Whenever I find an app (Google Calendar for example) I want to use, I watch youtube videos that go into detail about the different features and try to master the app.  

  

**PLEASE** let me know any questions or tell me anything you are more curious about. I love teaching any of this and can help you start working in a direction once you check some stuff out.  

  

I'm going to list a LOT of stuff here:

  

  

**STUDY TIMER**

  

I found that this method of study really lets me do some long sessions without burning out. The concept is - focus on work for 25 minutes without distractions, then take a 5 minute break where you leave your workspace. I get up and walk around, get coffee, do some push-ups, stretch, etc. It's called the 'Pomodoro method' and the 5 minute breaks really help me.

**TYPING SITES**  

  

I used this site until I could confidently type at 60 WPM with little errors. The prompts repeat a lot but it's great practice for developing accuracy.

I use monkey type occasionally now to warm up my fingers and check on my speed / accuracy.

**YOUTUBE**:  

  

Network Chuck - this guy changed my life. I didn't know what a modem or router was and my friend suggested this channel. I was turned off immediately by his corny-ness and gimmicky shit but overall this guy got me interested in how networks operate. I started watching his CCNA course and that's where I started. I didn't understand a lot but it changed with time.

Hardware Haven - this guy inspired me to set up my own server. I didn't even know what a server was when I started watching these videos. Uses a lot of old and low-powered tech to make some cool stuff.

**CODING**:

  

I will note that learning to code didn't really teach me anything I could immediately use. I really just thought it was interesting to see how it works. Just a precursory warning that I wouldn't focus much on it as a practical thing you will use at first, it's more of an interesting thing to check out for background understanding.  

  

Codecademy is the first place I ever tried learning to code from. It's excellent at showing you syntax and basic functions with interactive modules that guide you through each step. Tons of free material and great articles on topics that aren't coding as well.  

  

[https://www.codecademy.com/](https://www.codecademy.com/)

  

  

I used MyFreeCodeCamp in the past and liked it. Sometimes it's nice to use a different source.

**HANDS-ON / ELECTRONICS:**

  

Arduino - this is the brand name for learning how to build little devices. I think of it as adult legos with coding on the side. You build little breadboards with resistors, capacitors, etc. and then use code to control them. It is designed for young adults and has many fun projects that will show you how electronics work and how code can control them.

  

[https://www.arduino.cc/](https://www.arduino.cc/)

  

Raspberry Pi - this is a small computer ($25-80 depending on accessories) that is easily programmed. I made a basic game on one, learned basic Linux commands and actions, and when I was done with all the projects I turned it into an ad-blocker for my home network that has blocked 500,000 ads in the last two months.  

  

[https://www.raspberrypi.com/](https://www.raspberrypi.com/)

  

Pi-Hole is the adblocker application I installed on it. I wouldn't say it's a beginner project but with a little bit of learning network technology it is feasible.

**CERTIFICATIONS**:

  

It helped me when I had a target to focus on. I am not certified in anything but I use the certs as a framework to learn with.  

  

- CCNA is where I started. Then I found out this is proprietary to the brand CISCO and decided to go other routes, but this certification can get you a network related job.  

  

[https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/certifications/associate/ccna.html](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/certifications/associate/ccna.html)

  

  

CompTIA has the certifications I am working towards now. There are quite a few so I'll list a few that I think are most relevant.

  

[https://www.comptia.org/](https://www.comptia.org/)

  

CompTIA 'A+' certification focuses on hardware technology. It would open up the possibility of working in computer repair or working at a help desk for a company - someone says "hey my screen is black, can you make it work again???" or "hey the printer won't print!!" and you troubleshoot the device.

  

CompTIA 'Network+' is similar to the CCNA I mentioned above, but applies to general networking instead of Cisco branded products.

  

CompTIA Security+ is what I am aiming for - it is accepted by the federal government and is the most widely accepted cert for cyber security applications.

  

The Odin Project isn't really a certification, but is a common way people learn site design from scratch. It will teach you HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and how they work together. Completing this VERY hard course would help you create a portfolio of projects you made from scratch and is well known.

**CERTIFICATIONS STUDY**

  

NetworkChuck on youtube is where I started for CCNA education. I followed that for a bit before moving onto other certifications.  

  

Professor Messer - this is the most powerful source of free material I have found yet. This is where I learned A+ certification. I would watch every video in order and take detailed notes (great for practicing typing too). He covers A+, Network+, and Security+ certifications from CompTIA. I bought his practice tests for $40-50 and they were excellent.

**HACKING / CYBERSECURITY**

  

What I study the most is called 'Penetration Testing', which is when you get paid to attack some organization's network like a hacker. You determine all the security flaws they have in their network, attack them, and then bill them after you tell them the weak points.

  

TryHackMe is a site I used for awhile where I was introduced to actually attacking other computers. This site and the next one I listed let you attack computers in a safe environment where you can't fuck anything up permanently. Shit has blown my mind hundreds of times. This is the beginner friendly alternative to 'Hack the Box' I listed below. A good bit of free content but eventually becomes a subscription to access harder material.

  

[https://tryhackme.com/](https://tryhackme.com/)

  

Hack the Box Academy (not to be confused with HackTheBox, that's for people that already know how to hack). I have used this site for hundreds of hours. It can be VERY hard but I have never learned more from any other source. This will cover so many concepts, like Linux, using the terminal / command line, how a web application works.... there are so many things here. Most of which I had never heard of. I would say there's about 100 hours of free content, I just subscribed yesterday for $18 a month after using the free content for a year or so.

**NOTES:**

  

When I started learning this stuff I took shitty half-assed notes in a Word file. Eventually that word file was 100,000 words long and a total mess. Using apps and formatting to take notes really changed how I learn forever. I went from a dumb lil monkey to writing outlines that are nice to look at.  

  

Markdown Language is a basic formatting language that is free and open source. It uses plaintext and extremely basic text documents ( .md files) to make organized and attractive notes.  

You can take notes however you want to, but I recommend learning this basic format because you can feed it to applications that make it look beautiful. It can easily be used in many applications that make the notes interactive with links, hashtags, etc.

  

[https://www.markdownguide.org/](https://www.markdownguide.org/)

  

Obsidian is the free app I use to take all my notes. It makes Markdown Language look great, has a TON of features and support from the communities that use it. You can even use AI to help you write notes. I have cross-references in my notes to other pages of notes I've written, you can link to websites, use a hashtag system.... It's crazy how deep it goes.  

  

Additionally this app can be modified to have automated backups so all of your notes are uploaded to a private folder online where you can save them outside of your device. This is semi-complicated and if you're into that idea I can help you learn how to do that.  

  

[https://obsidian.md/](https://obsidian.md/)

  

I watch youtube videos from this guy - Nick Milo - to learn how to use obsidian. He really shows how the app is used to its full potential. I don't use everything he teaches but it helped me a lot with the fundamentals.

**PASSWORD MANAGER:**

  

I use 1password to save all of my credentials and they have a family plan so you can share with others. I only mention this because it's so damn good and easily works on every device I have besides my TV.

My Personal Notes:

  

Here is a link to my compendium of notes from most of the courses mentioned above. I am damned proud of my notes for Professor Messer's A+ course haha.
