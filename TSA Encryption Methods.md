### TSA Requirements

The TSA requires specific security and encryption standards to protect sensitive information and abide by regulatory standards.

#### Federal Standards

Sensitive Security Information (SSI) Handling entails any information where accidental disclosure could be detrimental to the TSA. All information related to security programs, contingency plans, and directives must be protected by appropriate measures.

Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) is mandated by the TSA to ensure the use of encryption methods that are FIPS compliant to protect SSI.
- FIPS 199 is a standard for security categorization of federal information and information systems.
- FIPS 200 indicates the minimum security requirements for federal information and information systems.

Information Assurance (IA) Requirements is detailed in the TSA Information Assurance Handbook. This document gives comprehensive guidelines about information technology security in respect to Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. This entails:
- Access Control Measures: strong access controls such as passwords, encryption, and network protocols.
- Compliance: Contractors must remain compliant with TSA's technical, management, and operational security controls to satisfy the requirements of the government's security policies.

Requirements mean entities handling SSI must implement appropriate measures to prevent any unauthorized disclosures. This means:

- Restricting access to authorized personnel.
- Using secure methods for storage and transmission.
- Ensuring that vendors and partners are aware of and willingly comply with SSI protection requirements.
- Unauthorized disclosure could lead to enforcement actions like civil penalties.

Compliance Recommendations:

- Implement Approved Encryption Methods: use tools and protocols that comply with FIPS standards to protect SSI.
- Access Control: only authorized personnel have access to sensitive information and that authentication methods are properly implemented.
- Awareness and Auditing: making sure that contractors understand SSI handling procedures and regularly assess their communication methods to ensure compliance.

### Solution Methods

An encryption tool must be used. Examples include: WinZip, 7-Zip, or AxCrypt.

###### Steps for Encryption

1. Draft an email in plain text.
2. Use one of the suggested tools to encrypt the text using AES-256.
3. Compose an email with non-sensitive information explaining that you are including an encrypted attachment.
4. Attach the encrypted document.
5. Explain how you will provide the encryption key in a secure manner (phone or password protected document).

##### Example Email

- Subject: Encrypted Communication for TSA Review
- Body: 
Hello \[TSA Contact], 

Please observe the attached file. It contains encrypted information to ensure we are meeting your standards for Sensitive Security Information communications. I am available by phone at \[Phone Number] to provide the encryption key per your availability OR I can provide the encryption key via password protected email.

Best Regards,
\[Jack at US Logistics]

##### Alternative via ProtonMail

1. Make an account at ProtonMail.com. Free for one email including 1GB storage and 150 messages daily. 
2. Compose an email within ProtonMail.
3. Click the LOCK ICON in the message toolbar to enable encryption.
4. Select a STRONG PASSWORD for the email. The content and attachments will be encrypted by AES-256 encryption meeting TSA standards and compliant with FIPS 199 and FIPS 200.
5. ProtonMail will generate a secure link for the recipient - they will need the strong password to decrypt and read the contents. Provide the password via secure methods like phone or password protected document.
