# Command Prompt and PowerShell

#PowerShell and Command Prompt ( #cmd) may seem similar but they are distinctly different. While both are native to all #Windows operating systems ( #OS), command prompt is older and less feature rich. PowerShell is a scripting language and the modern replacement that is capable of everything cmd is doing plus much more.
