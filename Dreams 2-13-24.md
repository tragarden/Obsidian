I dreamt that I was in a house with my ex Ashley and there were dozens of people around, all familiar to me. Old mutual friends that we had from highschool and middle school living in my old neighborhood. Shannon Sharpe ended up being at the house for some reason, needing to crash with us because his transportation was messed up. I'm pretty sure he was traveling with Zach Braff or Dax Shepphard (idk they look the same) in some sort of wooden covered wagon and they needed to stop for the night. I was ignoring her and somewhat starstruck by Shannon who was being really funny and relating to me for my ankle injury (which is currently happening in my real life) among other things. We made jokes about ochocinco and chilled in a separate room with a few other friends. He found it very novel that I didn't like football and we joked about that.

Eventually I asked him if I could take pictures with him to show my friends that love football and he was all about it. We started setting up on the covered wagon to take pics and my ex suddenly felt really ill and just laid down nearby, which was annoying to me because I felt like she was trying to draw attention to herself. I asked "hey did you get a picture?" to my friend Nick that I think was taking the picture. This changed the mood of the whole situation and everyone became upset with me immediately and thought I was selfish for not being concerned about my collapsed ex. I found this really frustrating and everyone was telling me that I was shitty and should feel ashamed of myself. She was lingering around me and continued to seek sympathy from our mutual friends and trying to paint me as uncaring and rude. Eventually I remember being in the house, dark and nearly alone although I think Shannon Sharpe was still present. I kept waking people up and feeling bad and embarrassed as I walked around in the very dim house. Pretty sure SS left in the covered wagon and then I woke up.

The next dream I had on this night involved my old house and living with my parents still. I had multiple instances where I screamed at Marc for something disrespectful he said to me. I would go down and scream expletives and that he was fat and lazy. He said that we would not be able to move into a new house because he invested all of his money in something. There were three mustangs parked outside, two black ones for my parents and a gold one for myself. i started the gold one and went back into the house to continue raging and ranting. I remember going upstairs but it's hard to remember what happened while I was up there. I somewhat remember drinking some juice or something. After expressing my disappointment again I went back outside and realized the gold mustang was missing. I looked around frantically and didn't find it. I went back inside and told my parents it was gone and I think someone stole it. When  I went back outside my friend Eli was in a gold colored Ford Ranger in front of my house with a look on his face that implied that he knew where my car was. I used one of the black mustangs to drive around looking for it but I don't think I ever found it. I remember driving on rt 24 in bel air and singer road, which is where I grew up for the most part.
