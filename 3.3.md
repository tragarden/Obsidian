#### LIMIT

The LIMIT clause constrains the number of rows returned by a query. This is an optional clause added to the end of a SELECT statement.

Syntax for the LIMIT clause is shown below:

>SELECT \<columns>
>FROM \<tablename>
>LIMIT \<rowcount>;

A functional example that will be used on our PostgreSQL database is:

>SELECT \*
>FROM invoice
>WHERE billing_country = 'Belgium'
>ORDER BY total DESC
>LIMIT 10;

#### OFFSET

The OFFSET clause is used to skip multiple rows when results are returned.

Syntax for the OFFSET clause is shown below:

>SELECT \<column>
>FROM \<tablename>
>LIMIT \<rowcount>
>OFFSET \<rowstoskip>;

#### MIN and MAX

The MIN function returns the smallest value from a certain column in a data or result set.

The MAX function returns the largest value from a certain column in a data or result set.

The two commands share the same syntax for statements, shown below:

>SELECT MIN(\<coulmnname>)
>FROM \<tablename>

>SELECT MAX(total)
>FROM invoice;

You can also return both functions at the same time with the following statement:

>SELECT MIN(total), MAX(total)
>FROM invoice;

You can also use the WHERE clause to specify results:

>SELECT MIN(total), MAX(total)
>FROM invoice;
>WHERE billing_country = 'Canada';

##### Other Data Types

MIN and MAX can be used with non-numeric data types. In the case of text-based entries, they will be listed as the minimum or maximum value in alphabetical order.

For example, the following statement would return two different results for countries:

>SELECT MIN(country), MAX(country)
>FROM customer;

The min would be Argentina and the Max would return USA.

MIN and MAX can also be used with dates - however it is important to note that these functions focus on  day number designated by a specific point in time. This will mean that older dates are interpreted as smaller then future dates, since the future date will have more days passed since the designated point in time. In other words, the most recent date will be the MAX.

>SELECT MIN(birth_date), MAX(birth_date)
>FROM employee;

#### COUNT

The COUNT function is used to count the number of records that meet a specified criteria. This yields information about the size or quantity of data within a table or result set. This can be used to analyze distribution, volume, or occurrence of data.

You can summarize and present aggregated information within your result set and use it alongside other functions like WHERE, GROUP BY, or HAVING to obtain counts of different categories or subsets of data.

The following statement will tell you the total number of customers:

>SELECT COUNT(\*)
>FROM customer;

If you wanted to find the number of companies within the customer table:

>SELECT COUNT(company)
>FROM customer;

You could use the following statement as an alternative to this method or as verification that the COUNT is correct:

>SELECT company
>FROM customer
>WHERE company IS NOT null;

##### Counting Distinct Values

If we were to use the following statement, it would count all the states in the customer table - however, repetitions of the same state would be counted:

>SELECT state
>FROM customer
>WHERE state  IS NOT NULL
>ORDER BY state;

This would return 30 rows as the result. The value CA was repeated multiple times.

To NOT count repetitions, we could use the following statement:

>SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT state)
>FROM customer;

This would return a row count of 1, but the count result would be 25 - the correct amount of unique states returned by the query.

#### SUM

The SUM command calculates the sum or total of numerical values within a column. This is useful when aggregating data and determining cumulative values. This can be used to tell you the overall magnitude, scale, or distribution of a dataset to analyze patterns and anomalies.

SUM is needed for calculating performance metrics or Key Performance Indicators (KPI) and allows you to aggregate performance related data.

SUM is an aggregate function that can be filtered with WHERE, GROUP BY, or HAVING. SUM will ignore any null values in a column.

An example SUM statement is shown below:

>SELECT SUM(total)
>FROM invoice;

An example of a SUM with specific criteria:

>SELECT SUM(total)
>FROM invoice
>WHERE billing_country = 'USA';

##### Special Cases

- If all values in a column are NULL, then the SUM command will return NULL as the sum. This is DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT than a returned sum of 0 - which was calculated from non-null values.

- If you try to sum a non-numeric column, you will return an error.

##### DISTINCT

The DISTINCT keyword removed duplicate records and only retrieves unique records. It enables you to limit query results to unique values from a specified column in a result set.

#### COALESCE

The COALESCE function returns the first non-null expression in a list. 

It is like a set of contingencies where if the first item on the list in non-null, it is returned. Otherwise, the second item on the list is checked and returned if it is non-null. This process continues until a proper result is found or the list contents are exhausted.

A NULL value can be assigned to any entry in any column in an SQL database, regardless of data type unless the table designer defined the column as non-nullable.

The substitutions made by the COALESCE function are not permanent - they will only persist for one SELECT statement.

Using the example table from the module - the invoice table shouuld not have any value less than one for the invoice_id column. If we wanted to return 0 instead of NULL in this case, we could use the COALESCE function.

If the total column is not null, an actual value is returned. If it is NULL, a 0 will be returned by the following statement:

>SELECT COALESCE(SUM(total),0)
>FROM invoice
>WHERE invoice_id < 1;

COALESCE statements can get complicated - here's an example:

>SELECT track,
>	COALESCE(subcategory, 'No Subcategory') AS subcategory,
>	COALESCE(category, 'No Category') AS category,
>	COALESCE(family, 'No Family') AS family
>FROM artist;

This statement would figure out which rows are incomplete so we could validate the dat for the track information for each artist.

#### AVG

The AVG function calculates the average for a set of values.

An example of an AVG statement is:

>SELECT AVG(total)
>FROM invoice;

Since averages can have long decimal answers, it can be helpful to place a limiter on returns:

>SELECT AVG(total)::numeric(10,2)
>FROM invoice;

This will show no more than two decimal places after the decimal point.

Other databases utilize the ROUND() and TRUNC() functions to limit decimal answers.

#### TRUNC

The TRUNC function is used to truncate numeric values or timestamps in PostgreSQL.

This function accepts the following parameters:

- numeric_expression - the numeric value or column to be truncated.
- decimal_places - how many decimal places the value should be truncated to. If omitted, the trunc function removes all decimal places and returns only an integer.

- When the decimal_places parameter is positive, the trunc function will truncate the numeric_expression to that number of decimal places moving towards zero. 
- When this parameter is negative, the function truncates the value  to the left of the decimal point.
- When this parameter is zero, all decimal places are removed.

Timestamps are truncate to a specified unit, like month, day, hour, minute, etc. All values that are truncated are returned as zeros.

In the following example, Pi is truncated to only two decimal places:

>SELECT TRUNC(3.14159, 2);

This would return 3.14.

##### NULL and 0

When averages are calculated, rows with a NULL field are ignored. This can skew the returned average as it WILL NOT count the null row. If you want the null field to be included in the average, you need to change the value to zero.

You can temporarily sub in zeros for the NULL values with a COALESCE function:

>SELECT COALESCE(AVG(total),0)
>FROM invoice
>WHERE invoice_id < 1;

#### ROUND

The ROUND function in SQL allows you to round values to a specific number of decimal places and can be used at a programmatic level so that it does not have to manually performed in repetitive scenarios.

The format for this function is shown below:

>ROUND(numeric_expression, decimal_places)

Use cases are shown below:

>SELECT ROUND(3.14159, 2);

This would output the value 3.14.

>SELECT ROUND(15.678, 0);

This would output the value as the nearest whole number: 16.

>SELECT ROUND(1234.5678, -2);

This would output the number rounded to the nearest hundred: 1200.

#### GROUP BY

The GROUP BY clause calculates aggregates within a group of rows, depending on groups created based on values in one or more specified columns.

It's used with SELECT statements after the WHERE clause and before the ORDER BY or HAVING clauses. It is often used with aggregate functions such as SUM, COUNT, AVG, MAX, and MIN to calculate grouped data.

The basic structure is below:

>SELECT \<column1>,... \<aggregate function>
>FROM \<tablename>
>GROUP BY \<column1>,...;

Here is a functional example where we are determining the number of customers in each country:

>SELECT country, COUNT(\*)
>FROM customer
>GROUP BY country;

Another example is finding the total amount of orders by country:

>SELECT billing_country, SUM(total)
>FROM invoice 
>GROUP BY billing_country;

##### Multiple GROUP BY

If we wanted to find the total AND average of each invoice based on state AND country:

>SELECT billing_country, billing_state, SUM(total), ROUND(AVG(total),2)
>FROM invoice
>GROUP BY billing_country, billing_state
>ORDER BY billing_country, billing_state

#### HAVING

The HAVING clause filters groups of rows based on a set of conditions for a group or aggregate.

The WHERE clause is not applicable to aggregate functions, so the HAVING clause can be useful in it's stead.

Suppose we want to only list countries where the sum of the total column is greater than 50. In this case, the WHERE clause will need to be replaced by the HAVING clause.

Here is an example where the WHERE clause will not produce an error, but also will NOT produce a result set:

>SELECT billing_country, SUM(total)
>FROM invoice
>WHERE total > 50
>GROUP BY billing_country;

This will successfully run, but will produce no result set.

We can examine the following statement that uses the HAVING clause instead of WHERE:

>SELECT billing_country, SUM(total)
>FROM invoice
>GROUP BY billing_country
>HAVING SUM(total) > 50;

Here is a modified version of the above query where we are returning the countries that have more than 50 total invoices. We will change the SUM to COUNT in the SELECT clause:

>SELECT billing_country, COUNT(total)
>FROM invoice
>GROUP BY billing_country
>HAVING SUM(total) > 50;

If we wanted to further extend on this query, we could order by SUM as well:

>SELECT billing_country, COUNT(total)
>FROM invoice
>GROUP BY billing_country
>HAVING SUM(total) > 50
>ORDER BY SUM(total);

Here is an example where we are finding the countries that have more than five customers:

>SELECT country, COUNT(\*)
>FROM customer
>GROUP BY country
>HAVING COUNT(\*) > 5;

We could further extend this query to also use AND and OR operators. We will implement this to check and see that the numbers of customers that also have a fax count greater than two:

>SELECT country, COUNT(\*), COUNT(fax)
>FROM customer
>GROUP BY country
>HAVING COUNT(\*) > 5 AND COUNT(fax) >2;

#### WHERE vs HAVING

SELECT statements can get pretty complex and in some cases may include both a WHERE and HAVING clause where WHERE is filtering individual rows and HAVING is filtering for groups of rows.

The HAVING clause will handle the aggregate functions.

In the following example, we will retrieve all invoices and costs from the invoice_line table for costs greater than 1, ordered by invoice_id:

>SELECT invoice_id, SUM(unit_price \* quantity)
>FROM invoice_line
>GROUP BY invoice_id
>HAVING SUM(unit_price \* quantity) > 1
>ORDER BY invoice_id;

Now we will extend this query to find invoice_id values greater than 100. To achieve this we will filtering out the rows that have unit_price > 1 before they are combined into groups:

>SELECT invoice_id, SUM(unit_price \* quantity)
>FROM invoice_line
>WHERE unit_price > 1
>GROUP BY invoice_id
>HAVING SUM(unit_price \* quantity) > 1
>ORDER BY invoice_id;

##### Step by Step Process

The following example will look at invoices for a specific set of customers where customer_id is between 20 and 30 in the United States. We are seeking any customer with more than one invoice and a total larger than 15. We will also get the total amount they have ordered historically.

It is important to break the query into pieces and take it on procedurally.

We can begin in a basic way: we know we are looking for data in the invoice table:

>SELECT \*
>FROM invoice;

This will return 63 records.

The next step is to return the customer_id with the SUM of the total AND the MAX of the total.

- The MAX of the total will return the greatest order.
- We need to determine if they have at least one order with a total greater than 15.
- customer_id is what we are grouping by.

>SELECT customer_id, SUM(total), MAX(total)
>FROM invoice
>WHERE billing_country = 'USA'
>AND customer_id BETWEEN 20 AND 30
>GROUP BY customer_id;

Next we will find t he groups that have a maximum of the total being greater than 15. Since this involves an aggregate function, we will need to use the HAVING clause:

>SELECT customer_id, SUM(total), MAX(total)
>FROM invoice
>WHERE billing_country = 'USA'
>AND customer_id BETWEEN 20 AND 30
>GROUP BY customer_id
>HAVING MAX(total) > 15;

Note that the customer_id is in the GROUP BY clause - it could have appeared in the HAVING clause as well. The alternative is shown below:

>SELECT customer_id, SUM(total), MAX(total)
>FROM invoice
>WHERE billing_country = 'USA'
>GROUP BY customer_id;
>HAVING MAX(total) > 15
>AND customer_id BETWEEN 20 AND 30;


# practice 

>SELECT billing_country
>FROM invoice
>WHERE billing_country = ('USA', 'Canada')
>GROUP BY billing_country
>HAVING MIN(invoice_id) > 40;

The above query is incorrect and does not work for two reasons:

- The '=' operator in the WHERE statement is wrong. You cannot use the = operator unless you are comparing only one record. You must use the 'IN' clause in this context.
- The HAVING clause is referencing invoice_id - this is incorrect and should be referencing all invoices using the COUNT(\*) function with wildcard as the input.

### Next Problem

The query I wrote is 

>SELECT artist_id, COUNT(album_id)
>FROM album
>WHERE artist_id BETWEEN 1 AND 20
>HAVING COUNT(album_id) > 1;

This did NOT work because 
- I did not include a GROUP BY clause before the HAVING clause
- incorrect COUNT logic in the HAVING statement

Here is my next attempt for solution:

>SELECT artist_id, COUNT(album_id)
>FROM album
>WHERE artist_id BETWEEN 1 AND 20
>GROUP BY artist_id
>HAVING COUNT(album_id) > 1
>ORDER BY artist_id;

This was an appropriate solution for the problem.

### Next Problem

# 3.4 Updating Tables


### INSERT INTO

The INSERT INTO statement creates a new row or updates an existing row in a table.

The syntax for the statement is shown below:

>INSERT INTO \<tablename> (\<column1>, \<column2>, ...)
>VALUES (\<value1>, \<value2>, ...);

This will identify the table the record will be inserted into and which columns will be present / affected.

The VALUES clause will provide the values for the columns indicated in the previous clause. Remember that dates, characters, and strings must be enclosed in SINGLE QUOTES not DOUBLE QUOTES. 

This statement must include all columns that have a PRIMARY KEY or NOT NULL constraint. Exceptions apply if the column has a DEFAULT value or sequence attached to it.

If we wanted to insert information about an artist into our existing tables, we could use the following statement:

>INSERT INTO artist (name, artist_id)
>VALUES ('Michael Jackson', 1001);

Sometimes existing constraints like Foreign Keys will prevent data from being inserted into an existing table. 

If we tried to insert the following statement:

>INSERT INTO album (artist_id, album_id, title)
>VALUES (999, 2000, 'Latest Hits');

We would get an error because the 'artist_id' value in the album table references the artist table, where artist_id also exists.

### Serial Data Type

The SERIAL data type us used to automatically generate an integer column with an associated sequence when new rows are inserted into a table. 

This is often used as a primary key or identifier column to ensure that each row has a unique value. This is a simple way of managing unique identifiers by automatically generating sequential values without manual intervention. This simplifies database development and improves data integrity by preventing duplicate or conflicting values.

The IDENTIFY property is an alternative to the SERIAL data type that is used to define an auto-incrementing column. This should work on any database you work with. This is a more flexible option that SERIAL data types as it allows for defining custom starting values, incremental steps, and cycling options.

You can control when identity values are generated by using GENERATED ALWAYS or GENERATED BY DEFAULT as an incrementing value for a record.

IDENTITY is also preferred for cases where cycling is required.

#### INSERT with SERIAL

If we want to insert data into a column with a data type of SERIAL, we will need to consider the special case factors involved.

Let's consider the creation of the following table:

>CREATE TABLE contact( contact_id SERIAL, username VARCHAR(50), password VARCHAR(50) );

While this is a brief statement, let's evaluate what is actually happening. This is broken down into the following statements to illustrate what is required to create the table:

>CREATE SEQUENCE contact_contact_id_seq;
>CREATE TABLE contact ( contact_id integer NOT NULL DEFAULT nextval(contact_contact_id_seq), username VARCHAR(50), password VARCHAR(50) );
>ALTER SEQUENCE contact_contact_id_seq
>OWNED BY contact.contact_id

The sequence table has the table name, underscore, column name, underscore, and then the sequence.

Now we will insert a record into this newly created table:

>INSERT INTO contact (contact_id,username,password)
>VALUES (nextval('contact_contact_id_seq'), 'sophia', 'Password1');

#### Adding Multiple Rows

We still use the INSERT INTO statement to add multiple rows. 

The statement for this follows the format below:

>INSERT INTO \<tablename> (\<column1>, \<column2>, ...)
>VALUES (\<value1>, \<value2>, ...)
>(\<value1>, \<value2>, ...)
>(\<value1>, \<value2>, ...)
>(\<value1>, \<value2>, ...)
>(\<value1>, \<value2>, ...)
>(\<value1>, \<value2>, ...);

### INSERT INTO with SELECT

When we need to load data from one table into another, we can use INSERT INTO and SELECT in the same statement. The SELECT clause will be embedded into the INSERT INTO clause to specify existing data we want to insert. Anything that can be queried by SELECT can be inserted.

The format for such a statement is below:

>INSERT INTO \<tablename> ( \<column1>, \<column2>, ...)
>\<SELECT ...>;

#### Summary Table

A common reason for using an INSERT INTO statement featuring SELECT is to create a summary table that will store point-in-time data. This would be useful if you wanted to save a list of invoices that all occurred on a specific date or range of dates.

#### UPDATE

The UPDATE statement updates values in one or more columns of a table in rows that meet specified criteria. 

The basic syntax for these statements are:

>UPDATE \<tablename>
>SET \<column1> = \<value1>, \<column2> = \<value2>, ...
>WHERE \<condition>;

The SET clause is where the columns are specified and their values are set. Anything not specified within the SET clause will remain as they are.

If we do not use a WHERE clause, the UPDATE statement will run on all rows in the table - this may change data unexpectedly. Make sure you are adding the WHERE clause to the UPDATE statement.

#### RETURNING

The RETURNING clause in PostgreSQL is used to return updated rows after an UPDATE statement has been issued. This is often used at the end of a modification statement as a way to ensure changes are valid.

#### ROLLBACK and SAVEPOINT

A Transaction is a set of steps that are tentatively made but not finalized until you commit to the transaction.

To begin a transaction, you will run a BEGIN statement:

>BEGIN;

Then you will performa various operations like inserting, deleting, or updating.

After you have performed the changes you want to make, you can use the following two statements:

- If the statement is successful and you wish to commit the changes:

>COMMIT;

- If you want to discard the changes:

>ROLLBACK;

A SAVEPOINT is a designated point within a transaction where you potentially want to rollback to if you aren't satisfied with a particular outcome.

To create a savepoint:

>SAVEPOINT my_savepoint;

To rollback to a designated savepoint:

>ROLLBACK TO my_savepoint;

If you want to commit changes and forget a previous savepoint:

>RELEASE my_savepoint.

#### DELETE FROM

The DELETE FROM statement uses the WHERE clause to indicate tables and columns we want to remove information from.

The basic format is below:

>DELETE FROM \<tablename>
>WHERE \<condition>;

If you DO NOT use the WHERE clause - you will delete ALL ROWS from your table!! This is akin to deleting the entire table and you should always use strong caution when using these features.

You can use the RETURNING keyword to return rows that have been removed rom you table.

##### Foreign Keys

You cannot delete rows that are referenced by the foreign key of another table - this will throw an error.

##### Delete Multiple Rows

We can use the WHERE clause to remove various rows at once:

>DELETE FROM invoice_line
>WHERE invoice_id BETWEEN 1 AND 10;

You can also do this by indicating a range with an operator:

>DELETE FROM invoice_line
>WHERE invoice_id > 50;
