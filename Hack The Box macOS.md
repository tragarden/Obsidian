macOS is the official term for the operating used on Apple computers. This is the second most popular operating system, following Microsoft Windows. It is most commonly used for home use, business management, graphic design, and artistic applications.

### History 

In 2000, Apple released the Kodiak variant of the original Mac OS X so that users could test it and provide user feedback. After receiving responses and making respective fixes, Apple released Mac OS X 10.0, named Cheetah in spring 2001. This was the first reveal of the new interface, named Aqua.

- OS X 10.1 was named Puma. This iteration improved system performance and began replacing OS X 9. 

- OS X 10.2, Jaguar, was released in Fall 2002. This iteration focused on interaction improvements and new applications like iChat.

- OS X 10.3, Panther, was released in Fall 2003. This was the first time Safari was available and replaced Internet Explorer as the default browser for Apple devices. Support for integrating with Active Directory was released at this time.

- OS X 10.4, Tiger, was the first to introduce widgets and dashboards. This was the first release of Apple products with Intel chipsets, replacing the PowerPC processors previously used.

- OS X 10.5, Leopard, was released in 2007 - one of the biggest years for Apple. The iPhone was revealed this year with iOS, which was based on Mac OS X. This iteration of the OS introduced Apple Time Machine along with support for 64-bit applications. This was also the first iteration of Mac devices that supported dual-booting via the Boot Camp app. This was the first time Windows OS could be used on Mac hardware.

- OS X 10.6, Snow Leopard, was released in 2009. The only changes were the addition of the AppStore and the discontinuation of support for PowerPC processors. At this point, Apple became based on Intel exclusively.

- OS X 10.7, Lion, was released in 2011. This brought successful features from iOS to Mac OS, such as gestures and saved window states. This also brought the introduction of iCloud to Mac OS X.

- OS X 10.8, Mountain Lion, released in 2012. This brought even more desirable features from iOS to the Mac OS X. 

- OS X 10.9, Mavericks, launched in 2013. At this point, Apple decided to adhere to a yearly release cycle for their OS. A change in nomenclature happened at this time - Apple departed from naming their OS iterations after wild cats and moved to locations and landmarks within California. Nothing substantial came with this release other than Apple stating that all future releasees would be free to upgrade.

- OS X 10.10, Yosemite, released in 2014. This revealed the addition of Handoff, which enabled users to move any task from one Apple device to another. The UI moved more towards the iOS look and feel. 

- OS X 10.11, El Capitan, brought performance changes and the ability to tile the screen with split views.

- In 2016 macOS officially replaces the OS X naming convention. With macOS 10.12, Sierra, Apple introduced integration for Siri, Apple Pay, and minor tweaks to the OS.

- macOS 10.13, High Sierra, released in 2017. This update made the switch to the Apple File System (APFS).

- macOS 10.14, Mojave, was released in 2018. This brought visual enhancements and the first iteration of Darkmode. Darkmode worked natively with all macOS apps and most third-party applications. Other iOS applications were brought over such as News, Stocks, and Home, among others.

- macOS 10.15, Catalina, released in 2019. This separated iTunes into multiple apps - Apple TV, Podcasts, and Music. This iteration further focused on bringing iOS features to macOS and allowed the use of an iPad as a second display via the Sidecar feature.

- macOS 11, Big Sur, released in 2020. This was the first version to move away from version 10 and brought notable changes to the UI and functionality of the OS. This iteration was the first to feature Apple Silicon processors while still supporting Intel processors for a period. Most of the focus of this iteration focused on bug fixes.

- macOS 12, Monterey, released in 2021. This brought integration improvements known as Universal Control. This brought ease to controlling multiple Apple devices at the same time. AirPlay underwent big changes, allowing the use of a Mac as a speaker when casting to other devices. Spatial Audio was introduced to FaceTime. SharePlay allowed you to share audio, video, and screen with other users via FaceTime.

- macOS 13, Ventura, released in 2022. This introduced a window management feature called Storage Manager. A facelift to the settings app, new Apps and app updates, and the Continuity Camera were released during this time as well.

Image Playground was a new feature that allowed for fun editing of images in Messages and Freeform, as well as third party apps. ChatGPT support from OpenAI was also available.

### Architecture 

Kernel: XNU

- The Mach kernel is the basis of the macOS and iOS XNU kernel architecture that handles the memory, processors, drivers, and low-level processes.

OS Base: Darwin

- Darwin is the base of macOS and is available for open-source use. Darwin was combined with other components like Aqua, Finder, and custom components to create the modern iteration of macOS. Darwin is a FreeBSD Derivative open-sourced by Apple.

#### Core Components

- GUI: Aqua is the basis for the GUI and visual themes for macOS. This provided additional support for other displays, rendering technologies, and more. It is known for it's flowy style, animations, and transparency of windows and taskbars.

- File Manager: Finder provides the Desktop experience and File Management functions. Aqua is responsible for the launching of applications.

- Application Sandbox: macOS and all apps use the concept of sandboxing to restrict the applications access outside of the resources needed to operate. This security feature limits the risk of vulnerability to the application itself so the macOS, files, and applications cannot be affected.

- Cocoa: the application management layer and API that macOS uses. It manages the behavior of applications within the operating system. It is also a development framework for bringing applications into the Apple ecosystem. Siri and notifications function because of Cocoa.

### GUI

The Apple GUI is powerful and one of the elements of macOS that draws users in. It is feature rich and understanding it is key to efficiency while working with Mac devices.

##### Components

- Apple Menu - point of reference for critical host operations like System Settings, screen lock, shut down, etc.

- Finder - provides the Desktop experience and File Management functions.

- Spotlight - serves as a helper that can search the filesystem and iCloud, as well as perform mathematical conversions and other tasks.

- Dock - located at the bottom of the screen by default, it acts as a repository for frequently used apps and currently open apps.

- Launchpad - an application menu where you can search for and launch applications.

- Control Center - manage network settings, sound and display options, notifications, and other items at a glance.
