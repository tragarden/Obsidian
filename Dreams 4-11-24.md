I was at some kind of stadium performance for a well known artist that I currently cannot remember. She was performing and there was a roman candle like thing that was being jammed into her ass and then shot out like a cannon as part of the performance.

I was in a mall or similar place with my parents and a very young dog. My mom was watching the dog and her and Marc both had edibles. We went to a Lego restaurant where they only had dessert and I was annoyed by that. After leaving we then tried to go somewhere else and I was very overwhelmed by the amount of people there and having to take care of the dog while my parents were very high and incapable of doing much. They weren't unpleasant to be around just incapacitated. The dog was very active and kept pooping little pellets out excitedly.
